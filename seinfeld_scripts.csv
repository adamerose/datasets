JERRY,Oh you are beautiful!,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?",1,S01E01,1
CLAIRE,"Id have to say, uuhh, no.",1,S01E01,1
(George shows his note-block to Jerry; it says very largely,NO.),1,S01E01,1
CLAIRE,To be polite.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,To be polite. I rest my case.,1,S01E01,1

JERRY,"Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...",1,S01E01,1

GEORGE,What?!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Laura.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Yeah, but how could you be so sure?",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,No.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S01E01,1

JERRY,Maybe youre right.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Youre gonna overdry it.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"You, you cant overdry.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Why not?,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,How could she not tell me where she was staying?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Look at that. Theyre done!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,(to the door) Yeah?,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,Are you up?,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Hey, Im sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets, and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"(from the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, thats what happened!",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"You know, I almost wound up going to that game.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years!,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, Do you mind?) Are you done with this?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,No.,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"When youre done, let me know.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,I thought I wasnt allowed to be in here this weekend.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,You want me to talk to her?,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,I dont think so.,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"That close, huh?",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,You better believe it.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(to the phone) No believe me, Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,(to the TV) SLIDE! Wow!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,A decent hotel-room...,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,I think I was affected by the caffeine.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Hey, he really likes you, George.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Well, thats flattering.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"Oh, hes gettin a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,Why even give her an option?,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"This is a person I like, its not How to score on spring break.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,So what? Thats good.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Now, how could that be good?",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,This is how you operate?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Yeah, I wish.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Let me just wipe the sink.,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,Why even give her an option for?,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,"(to George, pointing at the mattress) Its unbelievable.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Yeah.,1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,Hows the real estate-business?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.",1,S01E01,1
KRAMER,Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Well, I might be getting into that.",1,S01E01,1
KESSLER,(slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Really? How?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Cause its all in the greeting.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Uh-huh.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Right.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Lip area.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,You know a hug definitely good.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Hug is definitely good.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Sure.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Thats so brutal, I hate that.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,You know how they do that?,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,Hand sandwich.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Right.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,Guess who?,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Hey, hey.",1,S01E01,1
LAURA & JERRY,Heeeey!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Its good to see you.,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,Hi.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,This is my friend George.,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Hi, how nice to meet you.",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Hi, how are you?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,This is Laura.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Laura, sure.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,(to Laura) I cant believe youre here.,1,S01E01,1
GEORGE & JERRY,"Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Oh, thank you.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?",1,S01E01,1
GEORGE,"Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"So uh, what do you think?",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Ooohhh, wow! This place isnt so bad.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"(laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Uh, yeah, I think I do.",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"(referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible  and if its not, fine  for me to stay here tomorrow night too?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"No, Id love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that Im right open.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Really? What would you like to do?,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but Id just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.",1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"(to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, Im gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes its fine... No, were goin on a boat ride... Dont be silly... Im not gonna have this conversation... Look, Ill call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,(not excited) Youre engaged?,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"You, you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. And Im on this emotional roller coaster.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Youre engaged?,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"You know, I cant believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of we. Ugh, its a very stressful situation.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,(matter-of-factly) Youre engaged.,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Yeah, yeah, hes a great guy...",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S01E01,1
LAURA,"Youd really like him, you know, I cant wait to get on that boat.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Me too!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...",1,S01E01,1
AUDIENCE,Cheque.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine.

ELAINE,"Oh, bye. Good to see you.",1,S01E01,1
ARTIE,"Oh, we didnt meet.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.",1,S01E01,1
ARTIE,(correcting Jerry) Levine.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,"Yeah, obviously.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,Couldnt agree more.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Good.,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,Good.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Good.,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,Great!,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Great? Where do you get great?,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,Its great to... talk about... other people...,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,...Guys?,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,Yeah.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,No. A general guy.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,"What? No, its not a big deal.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"No, thats great! Thats terrific!",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,"No, we just met...",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him.,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,"Hmmm, I dont think so.",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,Wall street.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,And he happens to be pretty good lookin.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"(pause) All right, sir.",1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,And... hes hilarious.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?,1,S01E01,1
ELAINE,I staked out his health club.,1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?",1,S01E01,1
JERRY,"So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,(proudly) I am...the master packer.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Yes.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Just gimme your keys.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,(from the intercom) Yeah.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Okay, this is quite a place.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Theres more. The refrigerator.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Ill eat out.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,(to Jerry) Ready?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Yeah, one sec.",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"Hey, Elaine.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Hi.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,Coming to the airport with us?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"Oh, the actress-waitress?",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,So just kick her out.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Im not looking.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"No no no, this ones different. This ones a beauty!",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Yeah, whats it like?",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"I havent seen it yet, but its a two-bedroom, its on the uh, west 83rd, bout a half block from the park?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,How much?,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,You oughta at least take a look at it.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Really? Why?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Cause then I could move in here.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Ohhhh...,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Its time you got outta here anyway.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"I cant think about it now. Come on, Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Great, I had fun. Wheres the TV, wheres the VCR?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,What?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,They were stolen.,2,S01E02,1

ELAINE,A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Stolen?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,(to Kramer) You left the door open?!,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?",2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,(guiltily) The door.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,The door? You left the door open?,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Yeah, and?",2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,So the door was wide open?,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,Wide open!,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,(to Elaine) And where were you?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,No.,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,(shocked) How can you not have insurance?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.",2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,(theatrical) I made a mistake.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,These things happen.,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,Im human.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,In your way.,2,S01E02,1
POLICEMAN,"Lets see, thats, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that bout it?",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Answering machine.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"(disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.",2,S01E02,1
POLICEMAN,What do you mean?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Its a joke.,2,S01E02,1
POLICEMAN,"I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, well look into it and uh, well let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,You ever find anything?,2,S01E02,1
POLICEMAN,No.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Well, thanks anyway.",2,S01E02,1
POLICEMAN,You bet.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,I didnt get that joke either.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE ,"I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Again?,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,I dont know how you put up with this.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Yeah, tell im George.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out The Report. They give you Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,How do you get all that wood in here?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,They deliver it.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,They deliver wood?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Yeah.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,What do you tip a wood guy?,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,I didnt know there was a fireplace.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,A garden! I cant believe theres a garden!,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Would I have to get a gardener?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Yeah, you can get a gardener.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,You tip him?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,You can.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,(to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener!,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,You can tip a gardener.,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,You dont need a gardener.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Jerry, you can barbecue back here.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,They deliver the coal?,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Oh, then I gotta tip him.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!",2,S01E02,1

ELAINE,"Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,Its your decision.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Im takin it, Im takin the place. Im gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!,2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,(unenthusiastic) Congratulations.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,What about the couch?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do.,2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,What?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Yeah!,2,S01E02,1

ELAINE,"Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"(continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, cause I wanna get it in the hall.",2,S01E02,1
ELAINE,"Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Fifty dollars?,2,S01E02,1

JERRY,"(to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,"(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.",2,S01E02,1

KRAMER,"Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Yeah.,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Hard to imagine.,2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"Yeah! And get this I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.",2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"..you know, very casually,",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,Right.,2,S01E02,1

KRAMER,What stuff?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!",2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,"No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.",2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Okay, starting...NOW!",2,S01E02,1
KRAMER,Yeah!,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.",2,S01E02,1
GEORGE,I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin?",2,S01E02,1

"JERRY, GEORGE & ELAINE",Whats the rent?,2,S01E02,1
JERRY,"Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.",3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,I dont think you did anything wrong.,3,S01E03,1

JERRY,We can only thank God for that.,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Youre imagining this. Really.,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"Oh, no. No no no no.",3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,What floss? When?,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"Ah, mint.",3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.",3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"Yes, I am.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,What? You dont like this?,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,"(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.",3,S01E03,1

JERRY,Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,"Well, why not?",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.,3,S01E03,1

JERRY,Were going. Thats next Wednesday.,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,Oh. Who is this guy?,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,"Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Can you conduct your business elsewhere?,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.",3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,"No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Just break up with him?,3,S01E03,1
GEORGE,Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,The Truth.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?",3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.",3,S01E03,1

JERRY,Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.,3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Couple of tough monkeys.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,"Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Game?,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Wait. How does Horneck know you?,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,"Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea!",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,This is too much.,3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,"Wait, what pizza place idea?",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"Oh, no.",3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,You get to make your own pie!,3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.",3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,Yea.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,(from the hallway) Kramer.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,Yeah.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Perfect.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,Hey.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,"Okay, who wants meatloaf?",3,S01E03,1
JERRY & ELAINE,No thanks.,3,S01E03,1
KRAMER,(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"Oh, we finished early.",3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"M-hm, Ill bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your nephew?",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.",3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,Hi.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Were still friends.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along?",3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,"Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,Right. I forgot about choir.,3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.,3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.",3,S01E03,1
JOEL,What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics.,3,S01E03,1
ELAINE,Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"You know, I should really try something like that.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,You really should.,3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"Well, lets just take a look here.",3,S01E03,1
JOEL,"Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks, next Tuesday Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Lets see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan...",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.",3,S01E03,1
JERRY,"Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,I never heard him say anything really funny.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed. Im sure hes got super humor.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,I dont know. But he aint funny.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,No problem.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,I dropped a grape.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Pardon?,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Were you crying? I mean, its just a grape. Youll find it.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Robert.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Guys with cats... I dont know.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im, uh, seeing-",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Vanessa.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Vanessa, thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Youre getting what?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,A stock.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What stock?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Maybe.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,How highs it suppose to go?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Boy... I dont know.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Id do it but I dont have any money.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What kind of company is it?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Televising opera?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Some sort of electronic thingy.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Well, how much are you going to invest?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Boy...,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What if I lose it?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,All right. Twenty-five hundred.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Thats it.,4,S01E04,1
WAITRESS,"Yeah, can I take your order?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Tuna?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Oh, the dolphin thing?",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Theyre dying in the nets.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Hey, when Im driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.,4,S01E04,1
WAITRESS,Okay. (To George) What about you?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Ill have the tuna.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,Why didnt you do something?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?",4,S01E04,1
STOCK BOY,No puffs. Just flakes.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY ,Have you thought any more about that trip?,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"Yeah, Ive been thinking about it.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,I dont know. I just worry about trips like this. Its a lot of pressure.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,Really? Could we go fishing up there?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,They have marlin in Vermont?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY ,"I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Is that my paper?,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Bad news, my friend.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What? What news?,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER ,Sendrax.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Oh, cmon! Its down again?!",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,Two and a half points.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Oh, I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money!",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Hey, I told you.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Hey, I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(to the phone) George, whats going on?!",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Sell it, just say Im selling!",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days!",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"You know, I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Okay, youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up...",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Okay...,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"(looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,(going along with it) Oh No!,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Youre gone all right.,4,S01E04,1

JERRY,"Yeah, Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What friends?,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Well, its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people, Jerry. Im telling you. You know, theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"George- What?! Youre kidding... Well, whats wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, hes in the hospital.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,So you dont know whats wrong with him?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Well, this is it. Im selling.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Just give it a little more time.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Where?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,To the hospital.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,The hospital?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Im going to find out whats going on. All right?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way, whats happening with Sendrax?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Maybe hes resting.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Who goes to the hospital to rest?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"What are you, a doctor?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,All right.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.",4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,(to Jerry) May I help you?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.,4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,When did you bring it in?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!,4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,You got a receipt?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,I cant find the receipt.,4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,You should get the receipt.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!",4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,"Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.",4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,Maybe you asked for it to be washed.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,No! Dry-cleaned.,4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANE,"Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!,4,S01E04,1
DRY CLEANER,(looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Bless you.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY ,So what are you gonna do?,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Im no cat killer.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,How about we go over there right now and we shave them?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Id really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,He actually went to the hospital?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Yeah.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"Oh man, hes nuts.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Yeah, hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. Its down again.",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,How much are you down altogether?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,Wow.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,"Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,I really dont need to look.,4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.",4,S01E04,1
KRAMER,Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Fifteen seconds.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,You told him you knew Simons?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"Didnt work, huh?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,(laughs) Not quite.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,I know. You mentioned it.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Oh yeah, right.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"No, its got a little battery.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Well, thats good.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"No, its okay.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,Not especially.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,What can we do? Its raining.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"Oh, youve never heard of it.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"No, what? What kind is it?",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,I cant tell you.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,That stock? I thought you got out of that?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,I told you not to sell.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,You did not tell me not to sell.,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,I said the market fluctuates. Remember?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,Thats probably why we're-,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,What?,4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,Forget it.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"No, what? Thats probably why..",4,S01E04,1
VANESSA,"Thats probably why were staying here, because you lost money on the stock.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?",4,S01E04,1
JERRY ,"Im good, thanks.",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Im kinda full.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,So dont finish it.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,I dont like to discuss figures.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,How much?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?",4,S01E04,1
GEORGE ,No. Youd be surprised. You dont recover that quickly from a nose job.,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Oh god.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,Is that still from the cats?,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,"No, I just have a cold.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"So, what ever happened with that?",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,I gave him an ultimatum.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,He chose the cats?,4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Theyre very clean animals.,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...",4,S01E04,1
ELAINE,Superman can go back in time?,4,S01E04,1
JERRY,We went over that.,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,A robot butcher?,4,S01E04,1
GEORGE,"Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.",4,S01E04,1
JERRY,"Im always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, Is this the best lane for me? For my life? Theyre always a little bit ahead of you, Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there? Yeah, come on over here, pal. Were zoomin over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it. The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday well be going, (Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse.) Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,She cant kill me right?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, of course not.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,People break up all the time.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Everyday.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You tried.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"I kept looking at her face. Id go, Cmon, love her. Love her!",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Did you tell her you loved her?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. Id go, Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, thats, thats something. But, eventually you have to come back with, Well, I love you. You know, you can only hold out for so long.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Youre a human being.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Youre too nice a guy.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, Im sitting on the couch, shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Youre flesh and blood.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I told you when I met her.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,My back is killing me.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"You gotta go to my chiropractor, hes the best.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Oh yeah, everybodys guy is the best.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Please. They dont do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Hi.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Hi.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"Hey, what are you doing?",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Im letting you in.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"No, you wont.",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Okay.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Why cant you sit in the middle?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Please, it doesnt look good. Boy, boy, girl.",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Is it that obvious?,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"Hello, Jerry.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Hello.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Did you get a haircut?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, shower. So, where are we eating?",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"(singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know, Id go from nods to nothing...",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Really?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Yes.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,You would do that?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,If I was a different person.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,(to the intercom) Come on up.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"(to the phone) Oh, its you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Taste this.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, I just had a sandwich.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"No, taste it. Taste it.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I dont want cantaloupe now.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Youve never had cantaloupe like this before...,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,...all right!,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Uh-huh. Its good?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Its very good.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Good, huh?",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Good.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,I got it at Joes.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Uh-huh.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Its too far.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Im not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee?",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"See, the other thing is, if you dont like anything, he takes it right back.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Im outta there. I did it! Its over.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You did it? What happened?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Uh-huh...,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"I said, Listen Marlene, and then the next thing I know, Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going, Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up, Im one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"See, its never as bad as you imagine.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,I liked Marlene. Whats her number?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Uh, no, I, I dont think so.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,(to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Oh no, thank you.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Its the best cantaloupe I ever had.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"No, really. No, no, thanks.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"So, go get them.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Oh, no no, I cant go back there. Jerry, its so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, Id be right back where I started from.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,So forget about the books. Did you read them?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Well, yeah.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,What do you need them for?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,I dont know. Theyre books.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Theyre my books.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,So you want me to get the books? Is that it?,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"...so, it mustve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I dont know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, Marlene, just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,So whatd you do?,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"Well, nothing. Its no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didnt see what the big attraction was.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I dont see each other anymore, it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,No.,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I dont know how this happened.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Jerry, its not my fault.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, no. Its not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, weve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and shes in the middle of a sentence!",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"(disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes shell go, (imitates Marlene) Hello, Jerry? And Ill go, Oh, hi Marlene. And then its Jerry...",1,S02E01,2
JERRY & GEORGE,I dunno sometimes...,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,What trying to get off the phone?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"(more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go, All right then... You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Yeah. Yes, she is.",1,S02E01,2
RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Costanza?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Yeah.,1,S02E01,2
RECEPTIONIST,The doctor will see you now.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"(to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh, hello, Doctor.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room, theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it, but youre really looking at the other people. You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well, I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"So, how was it?",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this, feel that  seventy-five bucks!",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Well, its a first visit.",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Whats seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You cant do that.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Why not?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,Are you feeling weird?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, Im fine.",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,Nothing really happened.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Yeah, I know.",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,We just kissed a little. People kiss.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,Well... night.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,(belated) Good night.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Hey.,1,S02E01,2

JERRY ,All right.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Hips! See, its all hips.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Uh-huh.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,You gotta come through with the hips first.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,That is out there.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Joes?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, supermarket.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Well, is it good?",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Its uh okay.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Let me taste it.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"See, that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Im not taking it back.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"All right, Ill take it back. Im going by there.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I dont care about it.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,All right. Take it back.,1,S02E01,2
JERRYS MESSAGE,"Leave a message, Ill call you back.",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"(from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If Im not talking into the soap right now, call me back.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Well?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Marlene.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"(smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Yeah, I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,I thought you were trying to get rid of her?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"I was. But, shes got me, like, hypnotized.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Does George know?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"No, hed go nuts.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Yeah, no kidding.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, Ive seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I cant go any further, but... Shes just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I cant breathe. Its like a drug.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Whoa, psychosexual.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I dont know how Im going to tell him.,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Man, I dont understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Its partially you, yeah.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Well, he cant kill me, right?",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Youre a human being.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"I mean, she called me. I havent called her. She started it.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Youre flesh and blood.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Im a nice guy.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Hi.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"(excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you dont have to be home on time.",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Unless youre married to a dictator.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?,1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,Nope. No good.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.",1,S02E01,2
KRAMER,"Well, Im taking this back.",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,Yes.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You talked to him?,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Right.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"You said ""you little phony""?",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,This is amazing.,1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,"And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact, youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now.",1,S02E01,2
ELAINE,This cantaloupe stinks.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,(considers for a second) I dont care.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Youre kidding.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"No, I dont care.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You mean that?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Absolutely.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You dont care?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,No.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,How could you not care?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I thought youd be upset.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"I guess I should be, but Im not.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,I know. I know.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"So I can see her tonight, and you dont care?",1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,(shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I had to.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"He didnt do anything, Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that?",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,It was embarrassing to me.,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,"Oh, I was trying to make a point.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong?,1,S02E01,2
GEORGE,(gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"Im sorry, Jerry. I just dont think this is gonna work.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Really? I thought...,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"I know, Im sorry.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Gee, I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting.",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,You sure you want to talk about this? Cause I sure dont.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Of course I want to talk about it.,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,I saw your act.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"Well, to be honest, it just didnt make it for me. Its just so much fluff.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act, so thats it?",1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,Youre a cashier!,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,"Look, Jerry, its just wasn't my kind of humor.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.,1,S02E01,2
MARLENE,I heard the material.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.,1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job, they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well, right now, Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development, research, consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go, Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why dont you shower up, and well get some burgers and catch a movie.",1,S02E01,2
JERRY,"My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Lets pick it up right there.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you cant wear this!",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Are you getting that?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,I thought you were getting it.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Should I pick up?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,You want me to get that?,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Ill get it!,2,S02E02,2

HELEN,Hello?... Hello?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Hi.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Hi.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,(to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"So, howd you do?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,This is your greatest moment? A game?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"You know what my greatest moment was, dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,But its their 50th anniversary.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"First of all, I made plans with Elaine.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,So bring her.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I dont even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, Ive met them three times in my life.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then youll leave.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,How come he gets to leave?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"And its always about Jeffrey, right?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Morty, are you coming in?",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Hey, howd you do?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday.,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,Yeah!,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,(to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,What are you doing?,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,Levels.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Levels?,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Yeah, Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels, with steps, and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,You drew up plans for this?,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,No no. Its all in my head.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that.,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Oh, Ill be comfortable.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,When do you intend to do this?,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Youre doing this yourself?,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Its a simple job. Why, you dont think I can?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Oh, no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant, and Im positive that you wont.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Hey, thats some big job.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I, dont see it happening.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Well, this time, this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Seriously?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"I dont want you betting. Morty, dont let him bet.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Ill give you a year.,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,No no no. End of the month.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Its a bet.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"(to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"No, no. Im fine.",2,S02E02,2
UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, are you listening to this?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Yeah, Uncle Leo.",2,S02E02,2
UNCLE LEO,"So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?,2,S02E02,2
UNCLE LEO,"No, for the walking tours.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.",2,S02E02,2
UNCLE LEO,"Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Mickey Mantle?,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,(eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,Mmm... phenomenal peas.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Are you ready for dessert?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,(surprised) Youre going?,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Yeah, I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I cant dance.",2,S02E02,2
MANYA ,Cant dance?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Hes kidding, Manya.",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,Is that a joke?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"So, did you hear Claires getting married?",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,"Yeah, yeah..",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Horses? Theyre like big riding dogs.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,(angry) I had a pony.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, I didnt uh really mean a pony, per se...",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,"When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, whats wrong with that?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee?,2,S02E02,2
MANYA,He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony?",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,You! You said so!,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..",2,S02E02,2
MANYA,Thats it! I had enough!,2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,"Have your coffee, everybody. Shes a little upset. Its been an emotional day.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Ill drive you to the airport.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"No, were taking a cab.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"You know, you should give Manya a call.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Maybe I will.,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,Need any help with those?,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Its nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Oh, well... I decided Im not gonna do it.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,(laughing) Really? What a shock.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Goodbye, Jerry.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Take care.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Well call you.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Bye, Jer.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Bye, Dad. Take it easy.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Bye, Mr. Kramer.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Yeah. So long, Morty.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"So, when do I get my dinner?",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Yes, I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet.",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Ya well, theres no bet if Im not doing it.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Thats the bet! That youre not doing it!,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I could do it. I dont wanna do it.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.,2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,And it could be done.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!",2,S02E02,2
KRAMER,I dont want the levels!,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Who did you talk to?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Uncle Leo.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,And whens the funeral?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I dont know. He said hed call back.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"You know what this means, dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,What?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,What? Nothing.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,You dont think... What? The pony remark?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Oh, dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,You dont think that I killed her?,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,You know what the flight backll cost us?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, its just one of those things... Sure, sure, well see you then.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,The funerals Wednesday.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Two o clock, Wednesday.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Ah,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,What?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I didnt even know the woman.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,So dont go.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,"Jerry, no ones forcing you.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean, its the championship, Im hitting everything.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,I got my sport jacket.,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Youre not wearing that to a funeral.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Whats wrong with it?,2,S02E02,2
HELEN,It looks ridiculous.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I dont know what to do.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,(depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Two Forty-Five.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,And what times the funeral?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Two o clock.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,How long does a funeral take?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,So you cant do both?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,How can you even consider not going?,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,"You know, Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.",2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,"They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I know, and then you say to yourself, From this moment on, Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go, How? What can I do thats not wasting it?",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,"You know, I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,He has to go. He may have killed her.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.",2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Bender.,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,"Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,"If youre a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway?",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.",2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I dont know. Theyve been in there since, like, World War II. The rents three hundred a month.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.",2,S02E02,2
EULOGIST,"Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Well, the games starting just about now.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.,2,S02E02,2
NEPHEW,"Im not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. Im just an intern. I cant write a note to an airline.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I just wanted to say how sorry I was...,2,S02E02,2
UNCLE LEO,"Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Yeah.,2,S02E02,2
UNCLE LEO,"Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.",2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"You dont understand, Ive never paid a full fare.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Oh, me too.",2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,"Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?",2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,"Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya wouldve liked Phoenix.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?",2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,Of course its very hot there. Ill have to get uh air conditioner.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?",2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,Although they say its a dry heat.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?",2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,I dont even know if I should take my winter clothing.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.",2,S02E02,2
ISAAC,"Oh, the apartment. Jeffreys taking the apartment.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Oh, Jeffrey.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,You know Jeffery?,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE ,"Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.",2,S02E02,2
HELEN,Its raining.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Believe me, I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.",2,S02E02,2
NEPHEW,I cant. Ill get in trouble.,2,S02E02,2
MORTY,"Oh, for Gods sake!",2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Its never happened to me before.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,"And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,I thought there were two outs.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY ,It was the single worst moment of my life.,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,(smiling) What about Sharon Besser?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.",2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Wonder about what?,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,You know... (looking up) the spirit world.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,I never saw anyone play like that.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,But I went to the funeral.,2,S02E02,2
ELAINE,"Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.",2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?,2,S02E02,2
GEORGE,Not necessarily.,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?,2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police dont use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic, thats two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, thats it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.",2,S02E02,2
JERRY,"I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion wont even exist. It wont. I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing. Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet, theyre all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. Thats it. We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY ,I think Ive seen enough.,3,S02E03,2
SALESMAN,"Well, I might have something in the back.",3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front, youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.",3,S02E03,2
CUSTOMER,"Oh, I just read that. Thats terrific.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,(pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.,3,S02E03,2
CUSTOMER,Alton Benes is your father?,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,Yeah.,3,S02E03,2
CUSTOMER,I always felt he deserved a wider audience.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,Im not so sure he wants one.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,I guess Im coming. I mean...,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"What? What, you dont want to go now?",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"No, Ill go. Im going.",3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.",3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"So, thats why were not together anymore.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,What is this?,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,Try it on.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"Wow, this is soft suede.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,How much is it?,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,(shocked) Oh my God.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,You have no idea.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,I have some idea.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,No idea.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Ive got a ballpark.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,There is no park and the team has relocated.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes?,3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now, you know, What about the money? Whats money?",3,S02E03,2
SALESMAN,It looks wonderful on you.,3,S02E03,2

JERRY ,I paid what it costs.,3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,How much?,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Whats the difference?,3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,"What, youre not gonna tell me?",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing.,3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,Over three hundred?,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"Yes, but lets just stop it right there.",3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,Its over four hundred?,3,S02E03,2
JERRY ,"Really, Im not answering anymore.",3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,Is it over four hundred?,3,S02E03,2

KRAMER,"Well, are you gonna wear it?",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Maybe.,3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,Youre not going to wear this.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Do you want it?,3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,"Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"Okay, take it.",3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,"Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.",3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,What is that song?,3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,"Oh, its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators, buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"You know, Schumann went mad from that.",3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"No, you idiot.",3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,"What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot?",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer?,3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,"Oh, Schumann. Of course.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.,3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,"Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.",3,S02E03,2

JERRY,"Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I mightve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.",3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Absolutely.,3,S02E03,2
GEORGE,Its fabulous.,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,I know.,3,S02E03,2

Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.",3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?",3,S02E03,2

JERRY,"What, you dont want to do this?",3,S02E03,2

JERRY,"Oh, you didnt...",3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Great.,3,S02E03,2

ELAINE,"No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.",3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,"Hey, see, I like it like this.",3,S02E03,2
ELAINE,"Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,Ill try and remember that.,3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,"Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"Yeah, too bad.",3,S02E03,2
KRAMER,Im gonna have to do something about this lining.,3,S02E03,2
ALTON,(singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...,3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, Let us in, were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!",3,S02E03,2
JERRY,"The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back, I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,So you didnt ask?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"No, I froze.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Counter.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, So why dont you call her? I says, I cant. I couldnt, I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,He said wuss?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,So you called.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Yeah. Like a farm boy.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Right. So I call her up, I tell her its me, she gives me an enthusiastic Hi!",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Oh, I dont get the enthusiastic hi, Im outta there.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"All right, so youre chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"So, were talking, and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, What are you doing Saturday night?",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,And?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,She bought.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Great day in the morning.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Then I got off the phone right away.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Sure, its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Its amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear.,4,S02E04,2
CAROL,You do not.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"(in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Thats Irish.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Irish, Scottish, whats the difference, lassie?",4,S02E04,2
CAROL,"So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.,4,S02E04,2
CAROL,Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Oh, no, thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.",4,S02E04,2
CAROL,"(confused by his response) So, um, okay.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Okay.,4,S02E04,2
CAROL,Goodnight.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Yeah, take it easy.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Thanks again for the movie.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Youre welcome.,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"Id invite you up, but the place is being painted.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Oh, thats okay.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Unless you want to go to your place.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Okay... but theres no cake or anything, if thats what youre looking for.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,(frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"I think if ones going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Values are very important.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Thursdays great.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Are those Cotton Dockers?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Oh, I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Really? I like that commercial.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,You like that commercial?,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"Yeah, its clever.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"Yeah, thats the one.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,What could you possibly like about that?,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"I dont know. I like the, guys.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Yeah, theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA ,"Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you?",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"(annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it, that theyre not talking about the pants.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,But theyre talking about nothing.,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Thats the point.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,I know the point.,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,No one is telling you to like it.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guyll be like, I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy, thinking, What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Im supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,"Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,Hi.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Youre still thinking about this?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"She invites me up at twelve oclock at night, for coffee, and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"She invited me up. Coffees not coffee, coffee is sex.",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,Maybe coffee was coffee.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night.,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,Well some people drink coffee that late.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Yeah, people who work at NORAD, whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, Keep it up, dont blow it, youre doing great.",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call.,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,"Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,All shell think is that you like her.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,"Well, she wants you to like her.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesnt like me!",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,I dont know what your parents did to you.,4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,"Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.",4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,So you gonna use it?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY ,I dont think so.,4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,Its funny.,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,It is funny.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,I like to use my own material.,4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,Thats as good as anything you do.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Why do we have to leave?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, lets go.",4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,"Oh, see, this is the problem.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Youre kicking me out of my house?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Yes.,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,(encouraging) Dont forget.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"(to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples.,4,S02E04,2
CAROL,"(from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, its Carol, Ill get back to you.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Um, hi, its George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see, I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh, take it easy.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Im just gonna get my jacket, Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter, did you call?",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Got her machine. Im dead, Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead, Im a dead man. Dead man.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,What did you say?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now, Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiots on!",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,After one date you try and improvise on her machine?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Now Im in the worst position of all.,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,"Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,He did that?,4,S02E04,2
ELAINE,Yeah.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Somebody did that?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Shell call you back. Youre overreacting.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Not once.,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Never?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Thats amazing.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Thank you.,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Is there anything else about you I should know?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Yes, Im lactose intolerant.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Really?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um, Ill be right back.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, Im sorry, I didnt, I had no idea.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"Wait, wait. Hes in the bathroom.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but Ill come back.",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,You dont have to leave.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,You sure?,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Yes.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Okay.,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,Im Donna.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Donna. Oh, youre the one that likes that commercial!",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,He told you about that?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"(back-pedalling) No, he, he didnt actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes, hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this, to him...",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,(to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"What? (to George) What did, what did you say?",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Say? What? Nothing, I...",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,You told him how I like the commercial.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Well, so what if I said that?",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"Well, so, you didnt have to tell your friends.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"No, I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,(to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Boy oh boy.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what?,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.",4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,Hey.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.",4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,Oh. Cotton Dockers!,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...",4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,What? Where are we going?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Come on!,4,S02E04,2
DONNA,"Dont bother, Im leaving.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Donna, really, youre making too much of this.",4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,"One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Please, Donna...",4,S02E04,2
DONNA,I dont wanna hear it.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"I cant believe I said that. You know me, Im a vault.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Dont worry about it, it wasnt working anyway.",4,S02E04,2
KRAMER,What happened there?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Ill tell you later.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee, I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,You said that?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,I lost it.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,She did. Today.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,What?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,So she didnt get the messages.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,But what about the messages?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Elaines thing? How you gonna get in?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Ill meet her outside the building.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,You do it for me.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,What?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Come on, itll be so much easier.",4,S02E04,2

JERRY,What if she sees me?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Oh, you are such a wuss.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,A wuss?,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,Yeah.,4,S02E04,2

GEORGE,Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Tippy Toe? I dont think so.,4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,You dont like tippy toe?,4,S02E04,2

GEORGE,(to Jerry) Dont you find that strange?,4,S02E04,2
JERRY,Yes.,4,S02E04,2
CAROL,"Well, Ill just check my machine and well go.",4,S02E04,2
CAROL,"No, nothing here, lets go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.",4,S02E04,2
GEORGE,"Oh, uh...",4,S02E04,2
CAROL,"Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to, I could go, Excuse me, Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone, but I dont like that as much, because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!",4,S02E04,2
JERRY,"Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,What did you do?,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Mousse. I moussed up.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,I guess it was just a matter of time.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Well, looks are so subjective.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"(annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Maybe.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"(O.S.) No, Im not going up there.",5,S02E05,2

JERRY,"I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?",5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in Spanish) You can't give him anything from there!,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalkers things.,5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in Spanish) You offered them to him.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,(to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. Its a good thing her rent was overdue. Shed be rotting up there for a month.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didnt have her wig on. It was horrifying.,5,S02E05,2
MANNY,"(in Spanish) Harold, Come on, hurry up!",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"(to Manny) Whats the matter with you? Im talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.",5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in spanish) What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Whats the difference? Its true!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"So, its okay? I could just tell her she can have it?",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Sure, sure. Shes getting a bargain, too. Its only four hundred dollars a month.",5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in Spanish) Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Okay...,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Okay!,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"Hey, Harold, what do you think?",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.",5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in Spanish) It looks worse.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"(not understanding him) Hey, thanks.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,What was that all about?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"(coyly) Oh, nothing important.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Whats going on? What is that look?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,What look? Nothing.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Somethings going on here.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Would you please?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,What would you say if I told you that...,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Told me what?!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,...I got you an apartment in this building.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,(dumbfounded) No.,5,S02E05,2

ELAINE,You got me an apartment in the building?!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,I got you an apartment in the building.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,How did you...,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,No.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,She died.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,(thrilled) She died?!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,She died.,5,S02E05,2

ELAINE,"Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,All the time.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,All the time.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People, think about what youre saying!",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Thanks, see you later, Donna.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,What happened to you?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,You cant believe what I just did.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,What? What did you do?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"I could tell you what I did, but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,What did you do?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,How could I have done that?,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Done what?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Elaines moving into your building?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Yes. Right above me.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Right above you?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Yeah.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Youre gonna be neighbors.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,I know. Neighbors.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Shes right above you?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Right above me.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,How could you do that?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot, but with all due respect, Im a much bigger idiot than you are.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Dont insult me, my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,But I need the home bed advantage.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Of course. We all do.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Come in for two minutes and sit with me.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,I was just in there. Its embarrassing.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Oh, whos gonna know?",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,They saw me walk out.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Two minutes.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Tough.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"You know, the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"If they were fanatic about showers, they might.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"For that rent, shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse?",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Id like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Yeah, the guy with the flat head.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Hes a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Yeah, Ive heard that about wedding bands.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,I wonder if thats really true.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"You know, I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Im not doing that.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"Oh, man. You know, youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"No, Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you.",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"I told you I dont like these sponges, theyre too small! I want a big sponge!",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,You cant pick up anything with these! Theres no absorption!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Boys, boys.",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Hi, Jerry.",5,S02E05,2
MANNY,"Hello, Jerry. (in spanish to Harold) You tell him.",5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Okay,5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in spanish to Harold again) You tell him.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Your friend cant have the apartment, Jerry.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,What?,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I dont want to do it. Manny wants to do it.,5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in spanish) Why are you telling him it's my fault?,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,Because its true! Why shouldnt I tell him?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Hey, hey. I understand. Youre businessmen.",5,S02E05,2
MANNY,(in spanish) Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment.,5,S02E05,2
HAROLD,"Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Well, thats a lot of money. But, if thats the way its gotta be, thats the way its gotta be.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,What happened to you?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Religion, my friend, thats what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,(jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars!,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"So, she cant get the apartment.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Cant get it.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"So, she doesnt move in.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"No move. So, you see, its all part of a divine plan.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,And how does the baldness fit into that plan?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,(to the intercom) Elaine?,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Yeah.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"(to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Cause you know, I love Elaine.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,Of course you do.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) ""Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Well... theres a little bit of a problem.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you, but youd have to come up with that money.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,I know.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,I have no idea.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"(to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Im not moving in.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,What?,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,They want five thousand dollars now.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"So, okay uh whats the problem?",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,I dont have five thousand dollars.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"Cmon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Yeah, well, I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow?",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"No, thats too much money to borrow.",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Loan her the money. You can afford it.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,She doesnt wanna borrow the money.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"Oh, cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends?",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Of course Id pay you back..,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"Yeah, so whats the problem?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Who said theres a problem?,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Hey see He said hed loan you the money.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Thats okay. He doesnt care.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Get outta here.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Let me think about it.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Whats to think about?,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"(to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in, Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,You didnt want her in the building?,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"No, I didnt!",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,"Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she wont take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals.,5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Let me explain something to you. You see, youre not normal. Youre a great guy, I love you, but youre a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand.",5,S02E05,2
KRAMER,Because Im a pod?,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,Ill take it!,5,S02E05,2
ROXANNE,"Hi, Elaine.",5,S02E05,2

ROXANNE,There are so few true heroes left in this world.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Yeah, my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you, its tough.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.",5,S02E05,2
ROXANNE,"Oh, the marathon is great, isnt it?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Oh, yes. Particularly if youre not in it.",5,S02E05,2
ROXANNE,I wish we had a view of the finish line.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Whats to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you, its one thing after another.",5,S02E05,2
RITA,Is she here?,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Uh no no, shes working.",5,S02E05,2
RITA,What does she do?,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Shes an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?",5,S02E05,2
RITA,"I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. Its great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, shes a very luck woman. Enjoy the race.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,(calling after her) But..,5,S02E05,2

JOANNE,"Well, Jerry, itll be nice having a close friend nearby.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,(no amused) Fantastic.,5,S02E05,2
STAN,She can pop in whenever she wants.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,I know.,5,S02E05,2
JOANNE,She doesnt even need to knock!,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Its tremendous.,5,S02E05,2
STAN,Anytime of day.,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Im in heaven.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.",5,S02E05,2
RITA,"Oh, hi. (calling to someone) Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Im sorry, I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, whats so hard?",5,S02E05,2
SUSIE,"So uh, are you really married? Because, Ive actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,(laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that.,5,S02E05,2
SUSIE,"Thats too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses.",5,S02E05,2
RITA,Hey everybody! Here come the runners!,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"Oh, I wouldnt quite say that.",5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Im a guy  it always looks like that.,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,Nah...,5,S02E05,2
ELAINE,"Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.",5,S02E05,2
JANICE,"Ive never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. Its a shame youre married.",5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Umm, Im not. Its just a sociological experiment!",5,S02E05,2
JANICE,Please...,5,S02E05,2
JERRY,You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots!",5,S02E05,2
ROXANNE,(yelling out the window) Youre all winners!,5,S02E05,2
GEORGE,"But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"George, I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes, Im nervous... Are you listening to me?...

KRAMER,"Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work, cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people, isnt it? Theyre talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.",5,S02E05,2
JERRY,"I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet. (crowd cheers him on to tell them) Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. (audience applauds) Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. That's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didnt even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, You may have already won. Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, You have definitely lost! You turn it over, giant printing, Not even close! You open it up, theres this whole letter of explanation, Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest.",6,S02E06,2

I was singing, MacArthur Park, and I got to the part about, Ill never have that recipe again, and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments.

RAVA,Thats what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!,6,S02E06,2
ELAINE,"No, there are degrees of coincidences.",6,S02E06,2
RAVA,"No, there are only coincidences! Ask anyone!",6,S02E06,2
RAVA,"Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? Well?! Well?!",6,S02E06,2
MAN,Will you put that cigarette out?!,6,S02E06,2
RAVA,Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) Its just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. Youre trying to destroy us.,6,S02E06,2
ELAINE,Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?,6,S02E06,2
GEORGE,"Ma, will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay, fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me.",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,Im not happy about this.,6,S02E06,2
ELAINE,Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?,6,S02E06,2
GEORGE,"Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.",6,S02E06,2
JERRY,Really?,6,S02E06,2
GEORGE,"(casually) Sure, why not.",6,S02E06,2
ELAINE,"Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.",6,S02E06,2
JERRY,Cant you talk to your boss?,6,S02E06,2
ELAINE,"I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,(talking to himself) Im not happy about this.,6,S02E06,2
JERRY,"Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..",6,S02E06,2
GEORGE,"Yeah, hell have my parents.",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,(from the other side of the door) Police! Open up!,6,S02E06,2
RAY,Police?,6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Freeze, mother!",6,S02E06,2
RAY,Hey.,6,S02E06,2

RAY,Murder?!,6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!",6,S02E06,2
RAY,I think you have me confused with somebody else.,6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,Is your name Ray?,6,S02E06,2
RAY,Yeah.,6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Yeah, youre the punk Im looking for!",6,S02E06,2
RAY,"Hey, hey, are you a cop?",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Yeah, Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line, Kramer points to Ray, and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day, junior, cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and youll be sorry. You got me?",6,S02E06,2
RAY,Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about.,6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Good, good. Lets uh keep it that way.",6,S02E06,2
JERRY,"All right, all right. Whats the big hubbub, bub?",6,S02E06,2
GEORGE,"Kramer, I cant believe it. Oh, youre my hero!",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,Yeah.,6,S02E06,2
JERRY,"Kramer, what did you do?",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Well, lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court.",6,S02E06,2
GEORGE,"I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer, I dont know how to thank you!",6,S02E06,2
KRAMER,"Well, Ill think of something.",6,S02E06,2
JERRY,"People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker, whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.",6,S02E06,2
JERRY,"Whenever I see the news and they're hauling in some kind of terrorist, psycho, maniac, mass murderer guy. You notice he's always covering up his face with the newspaper, with the jacket, with the hat. What is he worried about? I mean what is this man's reputation? That he has to worry about this kind of exposure damaging his good name? I mean, what is he up for a big job promotion down at the office or something? Afraid the boss is gonna catch this on TV and go ""isn't that Johnson from sales? He's up in that clock tower picking people off one by one. I don't know if that's that kind of man we want heading up that new branch office. He should be in bill collection. I think he's got aptitude.""",7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,"(on the phone) Ha ha, she was great. You don't want to know. Hey Breaky, remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing)",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit!",7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,Hey.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Hey.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,"Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the roof to kill himself.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Well, what'd you say?",7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,"I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I said "" Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me."" At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,What's his problem?,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,No job. No women.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,He called the right guy.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,"Well, what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him?",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.",7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,How 'bout if I put a few things --,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,"Well, you're going over there.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a riot.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,Have you ever met my guys?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,No. I can't say as I have.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,Well!,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,All right. Put 'em on top.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,Ah!,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Oh, beautiful.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine?,7,S02E07,2
VIC,I'll have to charge you for another machine.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump across.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Guess what.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,How did you know I was here?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Kramer. Guess what.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,I don't know.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I quit my job.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Get outta here.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I couldn't take it anymore.,7,S02E07,2
VIC,You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket),7,S02E07,2
JERRY,What happened? Levitan?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well, (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,You and your toilets.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs),7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate?",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,So what are you gonna do?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I like sports. I could do something in sports.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,What about that?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are, you know, in broadcasting.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"Well, that's really not fair.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Movies. I like to watch movies.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Yeah. Yeah.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Do they pay people to watch movies?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Projectionists.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,That's true.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,But you gotta know how to work the projector.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Right.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,And it's probably a union thing.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"(scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a talk show host?",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Talk show host. That's good.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Really?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you start?",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Well, that's where it gets tricky.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna be a talk show host.""",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,I wouldn't think so.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,It's all politics.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,This could have been a huge mistake.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,(sighs) Guess not. What should I do?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Maybe you can just go back.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Go back?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Never happened.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,So what? You're entitled.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,I'm emotional.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,That's right. You're emotional.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Never happened.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Never happened.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in, in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in ""morning Bill, morning Bob, how you doing? fine"" Ten minutes later you see him in the hall, ""How ya doin'?"" Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow ""Hey"" You start coming up with nicknames for them. ""Jimbo.""",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,How ya doin'?,7,S02E07,2
GLENDA,What are you doing here?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,What? I work here.,7,S02E07,2
GLENDA,I thought you quit.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,What quit? (laughing) Who quit?,7,S02E07,2
DAN,"Bill, how was your weekend?",7,S02E07,2
BILL,"Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?",7,S02E07,2
DAN,Fine weekend.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,Yeah. Good weekend.,7,S02E07,2
DAN,"Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. (laughing) Lisa was a little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor someday.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.",7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,"Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?",7,S02E07,2
AVA,"Oh, I got a little tied up.",7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,I'll bet you did.,7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,"I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in Lasky's Bar, on Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing here?",7,S02E07,2

DAN,I wouldn't say all the time.,7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,""" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" This is what he said to me.",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Well, so that's that.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,No. That's not that.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,That's not that?,7,S02E07,2

JERRY,She knew that.,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.,7,S02E07,2

GEORGE,Revenge.,7,S02E07,2
JERRY,"Oh, the best revenge is living well.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,There's no chance of that.,7,S02E07,2

KRAMER,"I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window.""",7,S02E07,2

VIC,"Hey, you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying ""Not Responsible for Valuables""",7,S02E07,2

GEORGE,First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.,7,S02E07,2

ELAINE,Really?,7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"Yes! (both laugh) God, I've never felt so alive!",7,S02E07,2
JERRY,Maybe we should call this off.,7,S02E07,2
KRAMER,Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine.,7,S02E07,2

ELAINE,"Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!",7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,(confused) You're welcome.,7,S02E07,2
ELAINE,"People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?",7,S02E07,2

ELAINE,"Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.",7,S02E07,2
LEVITAN,Seriously?,7,S02E07,2
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.",7,S02E07,2
GEORGE,"(whispering) Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?",7,S02E07,2
GLENDA,(loud) What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.,7,S02E07,2

JERRY,"People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression 'The best revenge is living well' I've said this, in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice, doesn't really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean, those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him, 'Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting, french doors, a divan. That'll show those punks.'",7,S02E07,2

I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. ""Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies."" So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites.

GEORGE,"All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.",8,S02E08,2

GEORGE,(Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?,8,S02E08,2
TOR,"No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.",8,S02E08,2

GEORGE,I guess so.,8,S02E08,2

DOCTOR,What?,8,S02E08,2
ELAINE,Let go of my tongue!,8,S02E08,2
DOCTOR,"(Lets go) Oh, sorry.",8,S02E08,2
ELAINE,"Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?",8,S02E08,2
DOCTOR,I was going to kiss you good night.,8,S02E08,2
ELAINE,"A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)",8,S02E08,2
[Setting,Ambulance],8,S02E08,2
JERRY,You just can't leave him out there.,8,S02E08,2
DRIVER,I told him I was gonna mess him up.,8,S02E08,2
KRAMER,"Well, can you call him an ambulance?",8,S02E08,2
DRIVER,I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!,8,S02E08,2
KRAMER,"hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!",8,S02E08,2

JERRY,"How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?",8,S02E08,2
ELAINE,"Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.",8,S02E08,2
JERRY,"Hey, check the TV.",8,S02E08,2
TV VOICE,"(Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..",8,S02E08,2
JERRY,(Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.,8,S02E08,2

JERRY,"I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. ""Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life."" Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know, becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, ""I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!""",8,S02E08,2

JERRY,"I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, I don't wanna see the naked people.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Been a while?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,What?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,What was that look?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What look?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,The look you just gave me.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I gave a look?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Yes.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What kind of look?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I know that look.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Then what was it?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Why should I tell you?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,What about the look?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I don't know.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,You got something on your mind?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,No. Things pop into your head. You?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Things occur to me from time to time.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"No, of course not.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Thirty-seven.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,We know the terrain.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,No big surprises.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Nope.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What do you think?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I don't know. What do you think?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Well, it's something to consider.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Yeah.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I mean, let's say we did.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,What if.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Is that like the end of the world or something?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Certainly not.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I know.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,It's almost stupid if we didn't.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,It's moronic.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Absurd!,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"We, there are always a few.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Devastating.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship),9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,And that would be good. (Points to bedroom),9,S02E09,2
JERRY,That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Huh.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Right.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"All right, sir.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Now here's another little rule.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Yeah.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Well now we're gettin' somewhere.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,What about the kiss goodnight?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Tough one. You're call.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,It's brug-wa (?).,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Fine. Well.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Well.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,You ready?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Ready.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,So think you can handle this?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf),9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,Hey.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Hey.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,Got the paper?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Not yet.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,No paper?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I haven't been out yet.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,"Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I thought you'd like that.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Oh, this is huge!",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I know.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"All right, okay. Let's go, details.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, I can't do details.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,You wha?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I can't give details.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,No details?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I'm not in the mood.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"You ask me here to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Where are you sitting?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,On the couch.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Next to each other?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, separated.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Time?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Around eleven.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Okay, go ahead.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Boy, these are really bad details.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Better than before?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Not exactly.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Not exactly. What does that mean?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat)",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I think we've worked out a system.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Okay. No calls the next day.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,You ready for the second one?,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Spending the night. Optional.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"No, you see? You got greedy.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, that's the rule. It's optional.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I think you're wrong.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,I hope I am.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Is this yours or the roommate's?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,The roommate's.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Would she mind?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,She keeps track of everything.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Thanks.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Well, guess I'll get going.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Oh.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Well, I got that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Fine, go away.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Just go.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I'm having surgery tomorrow.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"But you said, it can be very serious.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Okay, so fine. Go.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,It has nothing to do with whose house it is.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)",9,S02E09,2
Tina,Hi.,9,S02E09,2
Elaine + JERRY,Hi.,9,S02E09,2
Tina,"Hi, Jerry.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Hi.,9,S02E09,2
Tina,Such a great improv class tonight.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Oh really?,9,S02E09,2
Tina,"I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?",9,S02E09,2
Tina,"Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,What are you doing?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I can't go if you're mad.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I'm not mad.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,You seemed a little mad.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,So you're okay with everything?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Definitely. Are you?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Definitely. Well, goodnight.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Rules.,9,S02E09,2
Tina,"Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I think I heard her say something about a bench.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,A bench? What kind of a bench?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"What, like at a bus stop?",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I don't know.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Like a park bench?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,I have no idea.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Who puts a bench in their house?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Forget the bench.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Nice looking fellow.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,What about candle holders?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Too romantic.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Lingerie?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Too sexual.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Waffle maker.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Too domestic.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Too Gubernatorial. (?),9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,Let's work on the card.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Maybe you won't like it.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,You could not like it.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Just the fact that you remembered means everything.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Cash?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Would do you think?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,You got me cash?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Who are you, my uncle?",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)",9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Pal? You think I'm your pal?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"I said, ""and more.""",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I am not your pal.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present),9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"Oh, what is this? You got me something?",9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,Yeah. Open it.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated),9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,"That's pretty good, huh?",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Great.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Well goody for you.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,182 bucks.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,(To Jerry) Yates.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Oh Kramer. (They embrace),9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Could you excuse us please?,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,What?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,We're talking.,9,S02E09,2
KRAMER,"Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"You know, we never had one fight before this deal.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I know.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Never.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Ever.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,We got along beautifully.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,Like clams.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,It was wonderful.,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,A pleasure.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I can't do it.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,You what?,9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,I can't do that.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. Hmmm. What do you want?",9,S02E09,2
ELAINE,"This, that, and the other.",9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?",9,S02E09,2

JERRY,I never should have made up those rules.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,Why?,9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,"It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.",9,S02E09,2

GEORGE,We'd have to kill him.,9,S02E09,2
JERRY,"We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.",9,S02E09,2
GEORGE,I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.,9,S02E09,2

JERRY,"Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching. You know, we just keep going, ""Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. "" ""What are you watching?"" ""I don't care, I gotta keep going."" ""Who was that?"" ""I don't know what it was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."" Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, ""Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel."" You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, ""Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of here. I'm going to bed.""",10,S02E10,2

GEORGE,"God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt.",10,S02E10,2
ELAINE,It was an accident!,10,S02E10,2
GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a groveling worm. ""What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?""",10,S02E10,2

JERRY,"(Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..",10,S02E10,2
MARY,Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.,10,S02E10,2
JERRY,"Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..",10,S02E10,2
MARY,"Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong, Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!",10,S02E10,2
JERRY,"No, I don't think that..",10,S02E10,2
MARRY,Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!,10,S02E10,2
GEORGE,"Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..",10,S02E10,2
LESLIE,Thanks a lot!,10,S02E10,2
ELAINE,I'm sorry you have to go.,10,S02E10,2

LESLIE,"Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.",10,S02E10,2
ELAINE,"(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) ""Like you were in college""?",10,S02E10,2

JERRY,"What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. ""I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other people. You won't be around me. But you will be around."" ""Take care now."" Did you ever say that to somebody? ""Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now."" ""Take care. Take care.""

JERRY,"(A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call, hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, ""Yeah, operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?""",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get right back to sweeping.",11,S02E11,2

ELAINE,Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.,11,S02E11,2

ELAINE,What?,11,S02E11,2

GEORGE (whistles to guy on phone),Hey!,11,S02E11,2

JERRY,She looks so familiar.,11,S02E11,2

JERRY,"I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,What do you mean?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I give you 50 bucks.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,What are they gonna do?,11,S02E11,2

ELAINE,"50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"No, no tricks.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Should I do it, George?",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE (through her teeth),"I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE (through teeth),I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.,11,S02E11,2
PEOPLE AT TABLE,What? What is she talking about? What did she say?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,What happened?,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,Did you see that?,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,What were you doing?,11,S02E11,2

GEORGE,I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!,11,S02E11,2
WOMAN,Well I won't be long.,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,That's not the point. The point is I was here first.,11,S02E11,2
WOMAN,"Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE (yelling at her),"You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!,11,S02E11,2
GUY,"Hey, sorry I took so long.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Yeah, well, he probably bought it.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,So what happened with Tatiana?,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,I shouldn't even tell you this.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Come on...,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,I'm with you.,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need...",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,This could only happen to you.,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left"".",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,You said this to her after.,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,No. During.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Oh, boy.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,Yeah.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Wow! So...?,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY (still trying to remember),Who is that woman?!,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone),11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Jerry, talk to that guy again.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,What am I gonna say?,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.,11,S02E11,2
MR. COHEN,"Hey, what stinks in here?",11,S02E11,2
Bruce (laughing),Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.,11,S02E11,2
MR. COHEN,"Well, I've been looking for a better place.",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,Better place... Want a table?,11,S02E11,2
MR. COHEN,"No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE (laughing),"Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that guy, he just came in.",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?,11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those people wouldn't get off the phone.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Didja leave a message?,11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Where do I know her?,11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE,"Hello, Jerry!",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?,11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE,How is everything?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Good, good, good... What's goin' on?",11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE,"Oh, working hard. And you?",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.",11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE,You haven't been around in a while.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"I know, I know... Well, you know.",11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE,You should come by.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Hi, I'm Elaine.",11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE (shaking her hand),Lorraine. Catalano.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...",11,S02E11,2
LORRAINE,"Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she leaves)",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE (smug),"Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in big, big trouble.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,The one you broke the plans with tonight?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt to my mother, my mother to my uncle...",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made!",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a table immediately.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Well what do you want to give him, change?",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,It's more than the meal!,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,"Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"I guess it's you, Jer.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Me? What about you?,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world of bribery, can they?",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,Give me the money.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,How's it going'?,11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,Very busy.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,Very good specials tonight.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.,11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,What is your name? (he turns the page over the money),11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE (Gives him the money),"Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,You lost the 20.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Well, how could he do that?",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,You didn't make it clear.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,Make it clear?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,Your name?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,Seinfeld.,11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Yeah, Seinfeld 4!",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant here.",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?",11,S02E11,2
BRUCE,"Oh. In about five, ten minutes.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,So?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,So when are we gonna eat?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Five, ten minutes.",11,S02E11,2
GEORGE,We should have left earlier. I told you.,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Oh, well I have to eat.",11,S02E11,2
JERRY,"Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.",11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?,11,S02E11,2
JERRY,We'll eat it in the movie.,11,S02E11,2
ELAINE,"Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?",11,S02E11,2

ELAINE,You don't need us.,11,S02E11,2

JERRY,"Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you know, ""This is good, who is this? I like this person"". You know, I mean, I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to wake up) ""Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry?

I have eaten rotten rolls off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book. What is this? The story of the bill? ""Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.."" What is this?

GEORGE,"Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.",12,S02E12,2

GEORGE,Where was pesto 10 years ago?,12,S02E12,2

GEORGE,Oooh.,12,S02E12,2

GEORGE,Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,"I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.",12,S02E12,2
JERRY,"(Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,"Oh, I said it in a kidding way.",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,I didn't know he'd get fired.,12,S02E12,2
JERRY,(Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.,12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!,12,S02E12,2

JERRY,"Oh, like you do.",12,S02E12,2

JERRY,Elaine?,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,(Through intercom) Yeah.,12,S02E12,2
JERRY,Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.,12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,Then why don't you try and get him another job?,12,S02E12,2
JERRY,"I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.",12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,"I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,What? Did you get the busboy's number?,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,"His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,How did you get all this?,12,S02E12,2

GEORGE,"Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.",12,S02E12,2

It's not a direct cannon, you have to change cannons after you land."" (Imitates cannon operator) ""I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a second..

GEORGE,"(Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?",12,S02E12,2
ANTONIO,"Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,"(Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..",12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,(Into the intercom) Yeah?,12,S02E12,2
ED,It's Eddie.,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..,12,S02E12,2
ANTONIO,"And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)",12,S02E12,2
ED,"Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!",12,S02E12,2
ANTONIO,"Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!",12,S02E12,2
ED,"Who do you think you're talking to, pal?",12,S02E12,2
ANTONIO,"Hey, get your hands off me!",12,S02E12,2
ED,Go to hell!,12,S02E12,2
[Setting,Coffee shop],12,S02E12,2
JERRY,He'll get another job. He's a busboy!,12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.,12,S02E12,2
JERRY,It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.,12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,"Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,"So, much longer?",12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,"Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?",12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,(Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.,12,S02E12,2
ELAINE,Take care of yourselves. (Leaves),12,S02E12,2
GEORGE,"I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.",12,S02E12,2
JERRY,Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?,12,S02E12,2
[Setting,Night club],12,S02E12,2
JERRY,"First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, ""Didn't you see my signal?"" ""Look at that fender!"" ..Then you'd see a real fight.",12,S02E12,2
JERRY,"Evry-Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. ""Oh, is he good?"" ""Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best."" They can't all be the best. There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, ""You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him. No, he's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."" And then there's always that, ""Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me."" Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, ""Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. And everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs.""",1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,"...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat whatever I want.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,What do you think the worst part of being blind is?,1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,Excuse me?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?",1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,I don't know.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.,1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,Well that's how my five-year old eats. He's a very picky eater.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?,1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,No.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.",1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,Oh.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.",1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA (visibly uncomfortable),Have you seen any good movies?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Who takes care of your boy during the day?,1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,We have a woman. Why?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,No no. I'm just saying.,1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,She had references.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.,1,S03E01,3
JULIANNA,"I don't live near here, ya know!",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,I don't like to talk during a massage.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Oh! I forgot to tell you--,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I'm in the middle of a story.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"Oh, okay, go ahead.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Why don't you ever go shopping?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,What happened?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"Oh, wasn't that terrible?",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Yes, it was.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Not even an apple.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I know it was stupid.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.),1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Hey, I just said it was stupid.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,What about this leftover Chinese food?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Take it.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,I can't believe you said that.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Hey, would you stop it already?",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"So, whatd she say?",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,I have a good masseuse you could go to.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Physical therapy is covered by insurance?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,You don't have to pay for the massage?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Not if you have a doctor's note.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,So where do you get this note?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Right, your friend Roy.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,What's the name of this physical therapist?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,And you don't have to pay.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"We have a, three-o'clock appointments.",1,S03E01,3
RECEPTIONIST,"George and Elaine, right?",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Right.,1,S03E01,3
RECEPTIONIST,"Could you fill these out for me please? And um, Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,(quietly) Ok.,1,S03E01,3
RECEPTIONIST,"And George, you'll be with Raymond.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?",1,S03E01,3
RECEPTIONIST,Yes.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"But, uh, Raymond is a man.",1,S03E01,3
RECEPTIONIST,That's right.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I can't get a massage from a man.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Why not?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"No, I don't want the man either.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,He'd just be touching your back.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,He'd just be touching your back too.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"No, it could get sexual.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,I wouldn't be comfortable.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I would? What if something happens?,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,What could happen?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,What if it felt good?,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,It's supposed to feel good.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I don't want it to feel good.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Then why get the massage?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Exactly!,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,George?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Yes?,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,I'm Raymond. (with a big smile),1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Hello.(with not a big smile),1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,"Are you ready? (smiling, he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall, handsome Raymond.)",1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Really.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,Use to be a flight attendant.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Oh boy.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,"Ya know, why don't ya, open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier that way.",1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,So what do you do?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,What?,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,"I said, 'What do you do?'.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I-I don't know.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,You don't know what you do?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Nah.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,"Ohh-ho, come on. Hey, you're very tense.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).",1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,"Okay, just take off those pants now, and I'll work the hamstring.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Oh, the hamstrings fine.",1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,But you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board),1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.",1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,I'll check it out. (makes a notation on the form),1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Are you sure?,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,"Yeah, take 'em off. (continues writing)",1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,How did you hurt this?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I don't know.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,You don't know?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,No.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,But you just told me--,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Korea.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,You hurt it in Korea?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,What?,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,The hamstring.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Korea.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,How?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Hamstring.,1,S03E01,3
RAYMOND,How did you hurt the hamstring?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Hotel.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,How'd it go? George?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,What's with you?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,A... ah...,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Yes, A...?",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,A man gave me...,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Yes, a man gave you...?",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,So?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,He was what?!,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh),1,S03E01,3
JERRY,That's a massage.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,And then I took my pants off.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,You took your pants off?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,For my hamstring.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Oh.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"He got about uh, two inches from... there.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Really?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I think it moved.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Moved?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"It may have moved, I don't know.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I'm sure it didn't move.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Okay, so what if it moved?",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,You think it's contact? It has to be touched?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,That's what a gym teacher once told me.,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Hey.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Hey.,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"He can have a donut,",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Yeah.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,but not at Dinky.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I never said I'd do that.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I don't know how I feel about it.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Alright, alright.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"A stall man, huh? (small laugh)",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,All right -- (Gets up to leave),1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand),1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,He didn't say he can't.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,He doesn't feel funny.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,If he does.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,He feels funny. You don't have to do this.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,He knows that!,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Oh, can you be any more dramatic?",1,S03E01,3
ROY,"Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he?",1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,How would I know?,1,S03E01,3
ROY,Do you like him?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"What do you mean, like him?",1,S03E01,3
ROY,Do you like him?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.,1,S03E01,3
ROY,How come you don't like him?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Why should I?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,What is the matter with you?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?",1,S03E01,3
ROY,"So, you want the notes?",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"You don't have to, really.",1,S03E01,3
ROY,"Nah nah, it's ok.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Well what about the week after?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over),1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over),1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,What?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Uh huh.,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,Yeah.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Joe DiMaggio?,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,That's right.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"Oh, he's a dunker.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Why couldn't he be a dunker?,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,So then what?,1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Why didn't you just call out his name?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,What happened to you?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,These kids called me a Mary.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,A what?,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,"I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,"Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.",1,S03E01,3
KRAMER (singing),"...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Joe, Joe. Go, Joe...",1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I told you.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,Told me what?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,I told you we shouldn't do it.,1,S03E01,3
GEORGE,He didn't say anything.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,Three notes?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Yeah, you, me and George.",1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,You got me a note?,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,But I got my own note.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,You what?,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,I got a note from my gynecologist.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Why'd you do that?,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,I didn't know you were getting me a note.,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,Of course I was getting you a note.,1,S03E01,3
ELAINE,But you didn't say anything. Ohhh,1,S03E01,3
JERRY,"Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.",1,S03E01,3

What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'""",1,S03E01,3

I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks."" Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit?

EVELYN,That's some good pen. It writes upside down.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,The astronauts use them.,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,What did Blanche say?,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,I never really wanted the pen.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,He gave him the pen.,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Morty.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,Why you don't like the pen?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"No, no, I...",3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,"Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Is that what she said?,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,Who?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Blanche.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,What are you talking about?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.),3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,(Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"All I said was ""I like the pen"".",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,How the hell do you work this thing?,3,S03E03,3
[setting,"still the condo, later]",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,"No no, I wanna go.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,But your back hurts.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,"Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,No. I'm fine.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,You're not too cold?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,No.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Don't be alarmed.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,Having a good time!,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,What happened to your eyes?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Well I started to go under...,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,With the instructor?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,I told you...,3,S03E03,3
JACK,Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,My back hurts.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,We got plenty of time.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,(to Jerry) What happened to you?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,It's from scuba diving.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,What's there to see underwater?,3,S03E03,3
(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like,give him back the pen),3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.",3,S03E03,3
JACK,You what?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)",3,S03E03,3
JACK,Well I mean...,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Take it.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,All right! (he smiles and take it),3,S03E03,3
MORTY,"You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.",3,S03E03,3
JACK,Whose pen?,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,His pen.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,This happens to be my pen.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,You didn't give it to him.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Where do you come off with this crap?,3,S03E03,3
JACK,"Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,You said you didn't want it!,3,S03E03,3
JACK,Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?,3,S03E03,3
JACK,Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!,3,S03E03,3
JACK,Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,I don't want it!,3,S03E03,3
JACK,I don't want it!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,"You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!",3,S03E03,3
JACK,Listen do you think I give a damn?,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands),3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,"yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.",3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Well. This should be a very interesting evening.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?,3,S03E03,3
[setting,"reception room, evening]",3,S03E03,3
PHOTOGRAPHER,Say astronaut.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,Say what? (laughing) Say what?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Astronaut?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Say it.,3,S03E03,3
"JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN",Astronaut!,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,"(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella),3,S03E03,3
JERRY,(to Leo) Uncle Leo.,3,S03E03,3
LEO,Hello!,3,S03E03,3
STELLA,Morty are you nervous?,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,What nervous?,3,S03E03,3
LEO,(to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,I've got a black eye.,3,S03E03,3
STELLA,(to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,(shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,(to Stella) Her back hurts.,3,S03E03,3
STELLA,"Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week.",3,S03E03,3
LEO,I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"No, no.",3,S03E03,3
LEO,You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.,3,S03E03,3
ELAINE,"(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!",3,S03E03,3
LEO,"Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!,3,S03E03,3
LEO,"You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.",3,S03E03,3
STELLA,"(to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,(laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.,3,S03E03,3
"(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells","""Hey Jack let's get started!"" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)",3,S03E03,3
JACK,"(on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,(to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him),3,S03E03,3
JACK,"Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,(Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.,3,S03E03,3
JACK,His administration did excel in one department the hiring of incompetents.,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,"(to Jack, loud) That's what you say.",3,S03E03,3
JACK,"But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,(loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up),3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Dad!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,"(to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!",3,S03E03,3
JACK,He gave it to me!,3,S03E03,3
MORTY,"Come on. That's enough, sit down!",3,S03E03,3
JACK,I'm not sitting down!,3,S03E03,3
JACK,Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.),3,S03E03,3
HELEN,"Jerry, do your act.",3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,They're all gonna leave.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry),3,S03E03,3
MAN IN THE CROWD,Who are you?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?,3,S03E03,3
WOMAN IN THE CROWD,(to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?,3,S03E03,3
MAN IN THE CROWD,I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!,3,S03E03,3

JERRY,Nothing.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,Good morning.,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Hi Evelyn.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,(to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,I don't think so.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,Well I'll ask him when he gets up.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,"Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.",3,S03E03,3
MORTY,Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?,3,S03E03,3
HELEN,I was very comfortable.,3,S03E03,3
EVELYN,"Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.",3,S03E03,3
HELEN,It's in the constitution.,3,S03E03,3

ELAINE,(to Jerry) Five more days?,3,S03E03,3
JERRY,Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers),3,S03E03,3
[setting,"night club, closing monologue]",3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going ""Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going.""",3,S03E03,3
JERRY,"So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!",4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,"Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Is he on the plane now?,4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,"Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Uh, just my next door neighbor.",4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,What's the matter?,4,S03E04,3

JERRY (to Farfel),"STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,If only.,4,S03E04,3

GEORGE,Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice),4,S03E04,3

JERRY,I want to but I can't.,4,S03E04,3

JERRY,"On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,So how long did you live there?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,About three years.,4,S03E04,3

ELAINE,Yeah. So I've been here about six years.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE (Counting on his fingers),"Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,I like herbal tea.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Jerry likes Morning Thunder.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Yeah.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,You don't tell him?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE (laughing),"No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, ""God, I feel great!""",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE (laughing),You don't tell him?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,No.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,That is so funny!,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,I know!,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Do you have to?,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"You know, the guy might have just lost your number.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,I'm in the book and I have a machine.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Really? How late are they open?,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,What?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,What is it?,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,I went back with Ellen.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY and ELAINE,"Ohhhhh, that's great.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Terrific.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,What are you doing?,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,I'm getting my pot.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Kramer, we like her.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said anything,",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Well.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Well.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice),4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,We'll see it Sunday.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,What does this mean?,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"I don't know, regular human time?",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Why shouldn't I go here?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,And isn't it more fun using the urinal?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Yeah.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Hey, go.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Who's stopping you?,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"What, are you doing me a favor?",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Like we care if you go to the bathroom.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,How's it going?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,Good. Good. You?,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Things are good.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Boy, he takes such a long time.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,I know.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,You know what he does in there? He gargles.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, he does it like six times a day.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,How come we never hear him?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,We talked about that already.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Oh.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,So what are calling me six times a day?,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Nothing except Prognosis Negative.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,I don't know what to do.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"I know, I know.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,It is kind of silly.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Of course it is.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Exactly.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,It's not like she's *in* the movie.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Right.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.",4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Good.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Saving movies.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,Ridiculous!,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.,4,S03E04,3
GEORGE,"Oh, you're dead.",4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,"Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.",4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,"Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians.",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!",4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,"He won't hurt you, he's just playing.",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,Hey you keep that mutt away from me.,4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.,4,S03E04,3
ELLEN,"Kramer, are you coming?",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Oh, hi Ellen.",4,S03E04,3
ELLEN,Get in here.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...",4,S03E04,3
GAVIN,Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,We made plans.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Why don't we just rent a movie?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, you promised me we'd go.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.",4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,You and George got together?,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Hello.,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,What's up?,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Well, ah you were right.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,About what?,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.",4,S03E04,3
"JERRY and ELAINE, together",Awwwwww.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Too bad.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,I thought she was the one.,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,I'll bring back the pot.,4,S03E04,3
ELAINE,"Okay, c'mon it's movie time.",4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Hey, what are you gonna see?",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,Prognosis Negative.,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,"Hey, that's supposed to be great.",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,It's not.,4,S03E04,3
KRAMER,How do you know?,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,I have an instinct for these things.,4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me."" But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?",4,S03E04,3
JERRY,"Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,enters,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.",5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,What's the problem?,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,It doesn't work like that.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,That orange dress is burned in my memory,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"Oh, memory burn.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,I wonder what ever happened to her.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,How did they ever find you?,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,You know I never got a library card.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,(to speaker) Coming down.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,I gotta go to the library. You want to go?,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"Yeah,",5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Where's George,5,S03E05,3
READER,Shhh.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,Tryin' to save a quarter.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,This woman's completely ignoring me.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Eventually a little shot of penicillin,5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,Yes?,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.,5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,"Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.",5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?",5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,It's true.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.",5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Can I speak with this Bookman?,5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,Just a second.,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"Jerry, Jerry",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,What?,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,I think I saw him. I think it's him.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Who?,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Yeah.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,yeah,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.,5,S03E05,3
READER,Shhh.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?",5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,George got him fired. He squealed on him.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,Ooh tattle tale,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,(yells) I didn't tattle,5,S03E05,3
READER,Shh Shh,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,What did this guy do? What happened?,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"Oh come on, You can tell me.",5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,Some other time.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,What tonight?,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"Oh, he sang like a canary.",5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,Mr. Bookman's not here.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Not here? Why was I told to come down here?,5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,He'll be out all afternoon on a case.,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Well what am I supposed to do now?,5,S03E05,3
LIBRARIAN,I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,All right Thanks. Come on lets go,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,Let's see if it's Hayman?,5,S03E05,3
KRAMER,"Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?",5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,Where's Karen?,5,S03E05,3
SECRETARY,She went to pick up lunch.,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,"Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.",5,S03E05,3
SECRETARY,She must have forgot.,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?,5,S03E05,3
SECRETARY,I don't know anything.,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,"Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know anything"", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said ""You're crazy.""",5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,"Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.",5,S03E05,3
LIPPMAN,"Elaine,",5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,"Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?",5,S03E05,3
LIPPMAN,Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,"Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.",5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,"What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!",5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?",5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,What did he do?,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, ""Costanza"" He'd say, ""Can't stand ja"". ""Can't stand ja"" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...",5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,Little baked beans,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Echh,5,S03E05,3

HEYMAN,Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"Yes, Mr. Hayman",5,S03E05,3
HEYMAN,Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.,5,S03E05,3
HEYMAN,"Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand?",5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,"I'm not really sure, I...",5,S03E05,3
HEYMAN,Well let's take a look.,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,He gave me a wedgie.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,He got fired the next day.,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,Why do they call it a wedgie?,5,S03E05,3
GEORGE,Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.,5,S03E05,3
ELAINE,Boys are sick.,5,S03E05,3

KRAMER,"Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?",5,S03E05,3

BOOKMAN,You took this book out in 1971.,5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"Yes, and I returned it in 1971.",5,S03E05,3
BOOKMAN,"Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,"Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.",5,S03E05,3

BOOKMAN,"I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?",5,S03E05,3
JERRY,Certainly not.,5,S03E05,3
BOOKMAN,"Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says ""New York Public Library""? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld.

GEORGE,"So I said, ""Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... "" He doesn't move. So I said uh, ""Can't stand ya'"", ""Can't stand ya'"" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth.

JERRY,No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.,6,S03E06,3

KRAMER,"Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?",6,S03E06,3

JERRY,I know.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,So why don't you just go?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,No I can't.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Don't you get tired of following rules?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,You think I'm too cautious?,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Buddy Hackett?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,He's a comedian.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,I know.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,All right. All right.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,(pointing) You can go over here.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,I can manage.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene),6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,It'll take you ten seconds.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Okay, okay. I'll be right back.",6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,"Okay, let's go. Come with me.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,But...,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,Come on.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.",6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,Well you're still not allowed.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?",6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,That's up to you.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,So you don't care if I die.,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,It was life and death.,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,Uh huh.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,I don't know.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.",6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,You can tell the police all about it.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,(CALLING OUT) Jerry!,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,Jerry!,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"No, no, I'll be back.",6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Does that bother you?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?",6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Not at all.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?",6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,I know what you did.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,Yeah I'm sure.,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.",6,S03E06,3
MAN #1,I can't do it.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,But why? Why can't you do it?,6,S03E06,3
MAN #1,I can't.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.",6,S03E06,3
MAN #1,That's right.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,But why? Why don't you want to?,6,S03E06,3
MAN #1,I don't know.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?,6,S03E06,3
MAN #,"1 No, I wouldn't.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.",6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,(NOT INTERESTED) Really.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Who's Killer Kowalski?,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,I've gotta go to the bathroom.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,So go. GEORGE Here?,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...,6,S03E06,3
SECURITY GUARD,Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?",6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,George! George!,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH),6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,(O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,(O.C.) Jerry! Over here...,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,(CONT'D) Where have you been?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,I was arrested for urinating.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,(PROUDLY) Me too.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,You what?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.",6,S03E06,3
MAN #2,Can't do it.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?",6,S03E06,3
MAN #3,Sorry. (THEY KEEP WALKING.),6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Elaine, shut-up.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Hey, where's Kramer?",6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,I thought he was with you.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...",6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,We came in over there!,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,We didn't come in over there!,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Where's Kramer?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Hey George, there she is again. ...",6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,So what do you want me to do?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,That is an opening.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...",6,S03E06,3
AMY,"Oh sure, I'll drive you around.",6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,You will?,6,S03E06,3
AMY,Sure.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.,6,S03E06,3
AMY,I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, right.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Filthy pigs.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,It's a blue Honda...,6,S03E06,3
AMY,This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,"Hi, I'm Elaine.",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Jerry.,6,S03E06,3
AMY,Hello.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.,6,S03E06,3
AMY,I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Hi Amy, I'm George.",6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,(CONT'D) ...with that group.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.",6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,I'll say.,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,The car!,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,The car!,6,S03E06,3
ELAINE,We found it. I can't believe it!,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!",6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Kramer!,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,Kramer.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Jerry?,6,S03E06,3
JERRY,"Yeah, over here.",6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Purple 23.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,What time is it?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Seven forty-five.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,Well at least there's no traffic.,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Right.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,What time does that play start?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,Eight o'clock.,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...,6,S03E06,3
KRAMER,(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?,6,S03E06,3
GEORGE,"She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,What's that smell? What are you wearing?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"What, a 'little' cologne.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Manly.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,Monica wants me to wear it.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,So why didn't you say no?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,I'm too nice.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,She wants me to take an IQ test.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"You know, I can't talk to you anymore.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Who thinks you're smart?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,What thing?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,What'd ya get?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,What did I get or what do I say I got?,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,What do you say?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,I say fourteen o nine (1409).,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"1409, that's a good score.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Psst, You're telling me.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,What did you really get?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,You are my friend.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Of course.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"I tell you everything, right?",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,I hope so.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Well, this I take to the grave.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Why do you keep watching?,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,And then you flush.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Well, it's a spider.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Bazooka Joe.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,The buzzer.,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,It's your house.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom),7,S03E07,3
INTERCOM,It's George.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Come on up.,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Casus belli.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,What's that?,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Have you gone in there?,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,Hey.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"I'm wearing some cologne, all right?",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"Sure, fine.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Casus belli.,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Casus belli.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,What's that?,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Since when do you wear cologne?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"I didn't take it, yet.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,What IQ test?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,What's casus belli.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Oh, it's nothing...",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,Is it about me?,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds like fun.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"You'll do well, you're smart.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Wha'd you get on your SAT's?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,It varies.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"You know, I don't even know my IQ.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"huh, Mine's 145.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,145!,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Get out of here!,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,You get out of here!,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,You get out of here!,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing),7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Shst, You should take the test for me.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Huh.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,Haha (laughs),7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,What?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Are you serious?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,Why not?,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,Where would I take the test?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"No, that'd be too noisy.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"Hey, what do you think?",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Hey, I love a good caper.",7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,You'll do it?,7,S03E07,3
ELAINE,What the hey.,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...",7,S03E07,3
Babu Bhatt,Welcome to the Dream Cafe.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.",7,S03E07,3
BABU,"Oh, ah how did you hear about us?",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Eh, people, people are talking.",7,S03E07,3
BABU,Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both.,7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Ah, non-smoking would be great.",7,S03E07,3
BABU,"Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot folded face cloth for your pleasure.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.],7,S03E07,3
BABU,"Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?",7,S03E07,3
BABU,"Oh, the turkey.",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.",7,S03E07,3
BABU,"You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...",7,S03E07,3
JERRY,"(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.,7,S03E07,3
MONICA,But why?,7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,"I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.",7,S03E07,3
MONICA,"Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.",7,S03E07,3
GEORGE,Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.,7,S03E07,3

ISABEL,What crop circles?,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Not a good sign.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?,9,S03E09,3
NEWSSTAND OWNER,Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,You got something in your teeth there.,9,S03E09,3

GEORGE,"Oh, nothing.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,What?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,You won't think I'm a bad person?,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Too late for that.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Yeah, she's got a big nose.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,It's a schnoz.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,A little.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Stop being so concerned with looks.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Have you said anything to her about it?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Alright, shut up, here they come.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"No no, he's never met her. She's in California.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Are you coming with me?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Why don't you just commit yourself already?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,What is so special about this jacket?,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,What's the smudge on your hand?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"What, you didn't wash all day?",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Kramer!,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,What? What?,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,How could you say something like that?!,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"No, it's ok.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,What did you have to say that for?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Well, I was just trying to help out.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,You see what happens when you try to be nice?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,You look like you've got something on your mind.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,How about him?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,They way he just says stuff.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,He sure does.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"So, what did you think?",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,About the pizza?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"No, about the nose job.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"I know, they're good.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Peter Jennings had one.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Really?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Uh huh.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,I hate the dentist.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,It's a cleaning.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,So you really think I should do this?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"Well, maybe I should.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,What the hell.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Me? I didn't say anything.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,You encouraged her to get one.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,I didn't encourage. No encourage.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Peter Jennings had one?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,It's possible.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"No, George is right. I want to get one.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,I think it's a mistake.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,We have time.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,It is exciting.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Then what?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,He still wins but it's not a blowout.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Good for you.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,It's not like that at all.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,How do you even know the jacket is there?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Well I don't, I'm guessing.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,George?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Yeah?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Enough.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Are you sure you want us here for this?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Yes.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Shouldn't a doctor do it?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,It looks good.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Great job.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,You got butchered.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Let's put him over here.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,(with hand covering nose) To the doctor!,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,How ya feeling?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Too much salt in my diet.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Can I get you anything?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Nah, I'm good.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,You sure? Anything?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"No, it didn't. No, it didn't.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"It's like, all dented.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Seems to be.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Shut up, George.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Shut up?,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Yeah.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Interesting.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"I don't have it, I threw it out.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"You're lying! You got it, I want that number!",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"I told you, I threw it out.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Give it to me!,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"I was lying, give it to me!",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"No, you told me not to!",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,I want that number!,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Yeah.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,You see this perinasal sinus cavity?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Oh, I got it.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, phew.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,What?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Remember we talked about taking a trip together?,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,We did?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Hawaii?,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.",9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,I never heard that.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,Oh yeah. My friend lived there.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,We could go to the Caribbean.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"George, I don't think this is working.",9,S03E09,3
ISABEL,"Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,I'm Nelson!,9,S03E09,3
ISABEL,"That's not the line, Jerry.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.",9,S03E09,3
ISABEL,"I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.",9,S03E09,3
ISABEL,"Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,(to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?,9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,"What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S PENIS,"Oh, go read a book.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,"Enough chatting, let's play.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Yeah.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,What do I need this for?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,Because we're engaged.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,We're engaged?,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,Um hm.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Kramer, this is too big.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,Hello?,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.",9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Yes, yes I am.",9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.",9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,My contention?,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"Yes, your contention.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"Yes, that's my contention.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,I heard him contend that.,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,It's too bad about your father.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Oh, it was a frame-up.",9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,She does fine work.,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,How kind of you.,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,"What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!",9,S03E09,3
ISABEL,"Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S PENIS,It's killing me. (Makes a move),9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,That's your move?,9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S PENIS,Yeah.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,"Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!",9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S PENIS,(beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!,9,S03E09,3
JERRY'S BRAIN,(before disappearing himself) Punk.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,"Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"My father, really? I had no idea.",9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,You don't say?,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,I found it!,9,S03E09,3
LANDLORD,"The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, ""Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!""",9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,So I grabbed the guy by the collar.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!""",9,S03E09,3
JERRY,So I assume the jig was up.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, pretty much.",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Hi.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,Hi!,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,Hey.,9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,(to George) Hello.,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,"(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,"(motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.",9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,"So, will I see you later tonight?",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,Not sure.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,"(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?",9,S03E09,3
AUDREY,(holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.,9,S03E09,3
KRAMER,Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.,9,S03E09,3
ELAINE,(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--,9,S03E09,3
GEORGE,(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.,9,S03E09,3
JERRY,How did you get fleas?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, ""You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?""",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,You know Ava's gonna be there.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Who?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,The nice one that works in my office.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Nah.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I'll drive.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, well, now you're talking.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,It's supposed to be a good party.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"What does that mean, good dip?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"No, there'll be girls there.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Got it.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,You got isobutane-30?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,I got isobutane-20.,10,S03E10,3

JERRY,White Plains.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.",10,S03E10,3
CASHIER,You gave me a ten.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I'm positive I gave you a twenty.,10,S03E10,3
CASHIER,I know what you gave me.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,You owe me ten dollars.,10,S03E10,3
CASHIER,Will you please step aside? Next?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--",10,S03E10,3
CASHIER,You.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"No, no, no, see you're not really listening.",10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,What's the problem here?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.",10,S03E10,3
CASHIER,He's claiming short.,10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,"Alright, let's just take it outside.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Oh, so you don't believe me either?",10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,"Come on, let's go.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"No, let's survey first. Camp here.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,(waving Eva.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.",10,S03E10,3
AVA,"So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?",10,S03E10,3
AVA,Yesterday,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I don't believe it.,10,S03E10,3
AVA,Ask Mark.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Mark, is this true?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,How old are you?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Whatever you want.,10,S03E10,3
GUY,You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah I did.",10,S03E10,3
GUY,So what do you do?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,(Patting his head I'm a comedian.,10,S03E10,3
GUY,Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,(still Patting) I hear a voice.,10,S03E10,3
GUY,What kind of voice?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.",10,S03E10,3
GUY,How come you keep tapping your head.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.,10,S03E10,3
GUY,"On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for something.",10,S03E10,3
GUY,"Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.",10,S03E10,3
GUY,I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, me too.",10,S03E10,3
GUY,"Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,How's it going?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Great, how about you?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,How do you account for this?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Well, she obviously liked you all along.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, ""Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him.""",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Anyway, I'm ready to go.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Now?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"If not now, when?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Gimme a half-hour.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Okay, half-hour.",10,S03E10,3
GUY,"Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Hey, I was dying over there.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.,10,S03E10,3
ELLEN,"Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Right.,10,S03E10,3
ELLEN,"Yeah, I remember you.",10,S03E10,3
WOMAN,I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?,10,S03E10,3
ELLEN,He's upstairs.,10,S03E10,3
WOMAN,"Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Maybe the dingo ate your baby.,10,S03E10,3
WOMAN,What?,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,The dingo ate your baby!,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,You ready?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,I do favors.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I think something's happening here.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I think she wants me to take her home.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Wow.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,What should I do?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Go! What could you do?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,What about you and Elaine?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,We'll get a ride.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Are you sure?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"We'll be fine, what did she say?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What? She said that?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Yeah.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Get out of here.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I swear.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What did you say?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I, I, I can't.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What did you say?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Please, it's--",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I... I... I long for you.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,I long for you?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"It's okay, that's not bad.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Really?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, come on.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"George, you're thinking too much.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I know, I know, I can't stop it!",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,(walking up) Pendant? Those bastards.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Excuse me.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Uh, no, he's taking the car.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,I don't know.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,You don't know?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, alright.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,I can't believe she's walking around in that.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Just don't make a scene.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Hey, is that real fur?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Oh boy.,10,S03E10,3
AVA,It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, good night.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Could we talk about this some other time?,10,S03E10,3
AVA,Are you a vegetarian?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Here we go.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.",10,S03E10,3
AVA,So you're a hypocrite.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-",10,S03E10,3
AVA,"Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Fish don't feel any pain.,10,S03E10,3
AVA,How do you know? Do you communicate with fish?,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Well, they're not kept in little cages.",10,S03E10,3
AVA,Ever seen a goldfish?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Goldfish.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.",10,S03E10,3
AVA,"Oh yeah, right. Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life. (To George) Let's go.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,That's why we're here in America.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,You're beautiful.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Call Kramer.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"No, I just live here.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Can I use your phone?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,What's in it for me?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,A bigger bill?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"He he, go for it.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,You sure you don't need any help?,10,S03E10,3
JENNY,"No, not really.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,I'm sure he'll be here any minute.,10,S03E10,3
JENNY,(To Steve) I want them out of here.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Call him again.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.",10,S03E10,3
JENNY,(To Steve) It's two o'clock in the morning.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Six hundred and twenty million people died.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Thousand.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?,10,S03E10,3
JENNY,"No! (To Steve) I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,"Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.",10,S03E10,3
JENNY,"You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, he's coming.",10,S03E10,3
JENNY,Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,That's him.,10,S03E10,3
JENNY,I'm going to bed!,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Thanks a lot.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Thanks, great party.",10,S03E10,3

KRAMER,I'm sorry.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Hey, it's okay.",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,Then how did you find the place?,10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,No problem.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Hey, I might take you up on that.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.,10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,But it's cold out.,10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Who is it?,10,S03E10,3
VOICE,Mr. Pocatello.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Who?,10,S03E10,3
VOICE,You mean you don't recognize my voice?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Jerry, baby!",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Do I know you?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"I'm sorry, uh-",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, okay.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,You certainly are. What's going on?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"No, really, I just got off the phone with him.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,I understand.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Look, you can hang out here if you want.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,Don't be so enthusiastic.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"No, it's-",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,I'm not gonna steal anything.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,I think I can do that.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,Yeah. Let's have lunch.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, me either.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, come on.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,I've never had a job.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What are you gonna do?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I have no choice, I'm quitting.",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"The party, Long Island?",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Kramer, right?",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"Hey, what are you doing here?",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,I'm waiting for my ride.,10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,Where's Jerry?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,How much is that?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Nine sixty.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Nine sixty? Give it to me.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Why?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Don't worry, I got it.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"What do you mean, you got it?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I got it.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,You're a lunatic.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What do you say to a person like you?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Just walk.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Oh.,10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,Scuse me. What do you got there?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,What?,10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,What do you got in your shirt?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Oh, I was gonna pay for this.",10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,(grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.,10,S03E10,3
CASHIER,um-hmm.,10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,You don't think I remember you?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,(more nervous) What are you talking about?,10,S03E10,3
SECURITY GUARD,"I know who you are, I was watching you.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?,10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,Not really.,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.,10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,(handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Hey, you want in on this?",10,S03E10,3
KRAMER,"No, I got a girl in the next building",10,S03E10,3
VOICE,"Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it. Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do.",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What the hell?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Jerry, this is Patti.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Nice to meet you.,10,S03E10,3
PATTI,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,What the hell is going on here?,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.",10,S03E10,3
PATTI,I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.,10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, Kramer huh?",10,S03E10,3
STEVE,"Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.",10,S03E10,3
PATTI,I ain't leaving.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Patti?,10,S03E10,3
PATTI,You got anything to drink?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Alright, how much does he owe you?",10,S03E10,3
PATTI,Fifty dollars.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.,10,S03E10,3
COP,This your apartment?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Yeah, but--",10,S03E10,3
COP,You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Wait a second, I--",10,S03E10,3
ELAINE,I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY & COP,Oh boy.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,He was a nice guy.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,"Oh, great guy.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Was there a red-headed guy there?,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,The one with the long sideburns?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Yeah.,10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,Where does he come off?,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.",10,S03E10,3
GEORGE,One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.,10,S03E10,3
JERRY,"Oh, we all hated him.",10,S03E10,3
JERRY,Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Was the alarm on?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,They cross the wires or something.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,They stole my car.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Who did?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,They did.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Was it more than just one?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"What should I do, should I call the police?",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,What are they gonna do?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Maybe you should call your car phone.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Are you serious?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, go ahead, call.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,I don't even know if I remember the number.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What do I say if he picks up?,11,S03E11,3

CAR THIEF,Jerry?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?",11,S03E11,3
CAR THIEF,"I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.",11,S03E11,3
CAR THIEF,"Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Sid left the keys in the car.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Who's Sid?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,What do you mean?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"What, do you pay him for that?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,How many people does he do that for?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"The whole block, forty, fifty cars.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Could anybody do that?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hey Sid, what happened?",11,S03E11,3
SID,"I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,You left the keys in the car?,11,S03E11,3
SID,"Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,You know I'm in that movie?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,You are?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm an extra.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,How'd you get that?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Right out of the clear blue sky?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Clear blue sky!,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"Well, why didn't they ask me?",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,I got a quality.,11,S03E11,3
SID,"Jerry, you got insurance, right?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.",11,S03E11,3
SID,"Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,This Wednesday?,11,S03E11,3
SID,"No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.,11,S03E11,3
SID,"If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?",11,S03E11,3
SID,"Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Maybe I could move them until you get back.,11,S03E11,3
SID,What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,I'm in a transition phase right now.,11,S03E11,3
SID,"Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Owen March, I never heard of him.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Well, he's not a baseball player.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What's that?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,He's sixty-six years old.,11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Next please.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Well, go, go.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Can I help you? Name please?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Okay, let's see here.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Sixty-six years old?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.,11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,I know why we have reservations.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,What?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,But we do have a compact if you would like that.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Fine.,11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Please fill this out.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,I just don't enjoy being with him.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Well that's what's important.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,How many times you been out with him?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Seven?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Face to face.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Hmm... How's the pasta over there?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa!!",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What is going on out there?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Today?!,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Yeah.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,He was laughing?!,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,So then what?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,I got a line in the movie!,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Get out!,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,That's great!,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Pretty good, huh?",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,You mean *a* career.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,So was Mia Farrow there?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Uh, I didn't see him.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,What's your line?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, ""Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.""",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Is that how you're gonna say it?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"No, no, I'm working on it.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Do it like this. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty.""",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"No. ""These pretzels are making me thirsty.""",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"""These pretzels are making me thirsty!!""",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,That was no good?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,I didn't say anything.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,I'm gonna go break up with Owen.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Oh my god.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Call an ambulance.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Boy, he took it hard.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Tell then to hurry! Hurry!,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Kramer.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,What happened here?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,What extremities?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,What's an extremity?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"You raise the feet, get blood to the head.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,I don't have a washcloth.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Well use a paper towel.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,You can't put a paper towel on his head.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,What about a big sponge?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,How you gonna hold it on there?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Use a belt.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Should we walk him around?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE and KRAMER,"(at the same time) Yes, yes.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, I've seen them do that.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"No, no that's for a drug overdose.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Maybe that's what he's got.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,He is not a drug addict!,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,A cookie!,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Can you give him a cookie?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,How's he gonna chew it?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Cookies don't liquefy.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Alright I'll get a blender.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What blender? I don't have a blender.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,You got a blender.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,I would know if I had a blender.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Where is the ambulance?!,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,I can't believe what's going on out here.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?",11,S03E11,3
VOICE,Paramedics.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Come on up. Okay, they're here.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,He seems to be breathing.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,I know.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Almost.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,It's not an easy thing to bring up.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Yeah, that's true.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"He does, how'd you know that?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,I could tell.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"What happened, what took you so long?!",11,S03E11,3
PARAMEDIC,"We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Oh man.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What happened to the car?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,This guy I'm seeing.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,What happened?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,We don't know!,11,S03E11,3
PARAMEDIC,Who put cookies in his mouth?,11,S03E11,3
JERRY and ELAINE,Cookies?,11,S03E11,3
PARAMEDIC,You're not supposed to do that.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,So how'd you hit the car?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"It's not even my car, it's a rental.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Woody mentioned me? What did he say?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Should I apologize to Woody?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.",11,S03E11,3
SID,Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Well I know how to drive.,11,S03E11,3
SID,Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Can I get anybody anything?,11,S03E11,3
SID,Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"I put my pants on, Sid.",11,S03E11,3
SID,"I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.",11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.,11,S03E11,3
SID,Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Maybe I could call my father.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Hey, you seen the paper yet?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.,11,S03E11,3
SID,Oh lord.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Can he communicate?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What community? There's a community?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Of course there's a community.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"That is right, somebody else was driving.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Uh huh, what's that?",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,You're not covered for other drivers.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Other drivers?,11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Um hm.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,Not that particular one.,11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?",11,S03E11,3
RENTAL CAR AGENT,"Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,These pretzels are making me thirsty.,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,An overdose of odor? Good question.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,Do I smell?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Ahh.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,He's alright?,11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Let me get that.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"No no no, I got it.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,Please.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,What are you doing here?,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,I got fired from the movie.,11,S03E11,3
GEORGE,"Get out of here, why?",11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.",11,S03E11,3
ELAINE,Aww.,11,S03E11,3
KRAMER,"Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.",11,S03E11,3
JERRY,"I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Like you do.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Why did France give that to us anyway?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,It was a gift.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,So countries just exchange gifts like that?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,If they like each other.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,There's Elaine.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Really? They work here in the office?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Really?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"""Off the wagon""?",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I think it's off the wagon.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"I think it's ""on the wagon"".",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, George, what are you doing here?",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present),12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry),12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Where did you find it?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Under the sofa cushion.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,And you stopped by just to give it to me?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,It's your Christmas present.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,I though I'd never find it.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Well today's your lucky day.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,No. Today's *your* lucky day.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,It will be my first one.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,You want to work here?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Huh?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.",12,S03E12,3
DICK,Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"""The guy?""",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,(softly to Dick) Dick.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,How can you just get it?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Cranberry juice?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,And vodka.,12,S03E12,3
DICK,I got the cranberry juice.,12,S03E12,3
DICK,So... you're Jerry.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink),12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,(What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.",12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,How do you read?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,I like Mike Lubika.,12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,Mike Lubika?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...,12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,"No, no, no. I mean authors.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.,12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,Name a couple.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.",12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,Art Vandelay?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.",12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,What has he written?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Venetian Blinds.,12,S03E12,3
DICK,(picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Where's my drink?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,I think he was impressed.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Told you.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Do I really have to buy her something?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,What is that? Is that cashmere?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yeah. She would love cashmere.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Wow. Excuse me, Miss?",12,S03E12,3
SALES WOMAN,Yes?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?,12,S03E12,3
SALES WOMAN,"(showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,What? I don't see anything.,12,S03E12,3
SALES WOMAN,See this red dot?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Oh yeah.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater),12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?,12,S03E12,3
SALES WOMAN,There's no exchanges on this.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,You think she would care about the red dot?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,It's hard to say.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Well I can see it.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, but you know where it is.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,You want me to take an overview?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Please.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yeah so?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"Oh boy, can you smell it?",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,No. I can't smell it.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,You don't always smell someone from a drink.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yes you do.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yes you would.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,Okay.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Would you take a drink and let us smell you?,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,You can smell me without the drink.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,"Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,All right.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I don't smell anything.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Maybe we're too close to the bottle.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yeah.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,(over the speaker) It's George.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Come on up.,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,"That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Hello everybody.,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,"Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,(uncomfortablly) Thank you.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Hey what's that?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,It's an early Christmas present.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Christmas present? For who?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,For you.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,"Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Kramer. Yeah that'll do.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Of course it's cashmere.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Oh, I love cashmere.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Well who doesn't.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"My, George this must have cost a fortune.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Ahh, money.",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.",12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,What's that red dot on your sweater?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,What?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,What don't you know?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I don't know.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Well do you see it or don't you?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Ahem. Say that again?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Do you see it or don't you?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Now what did you ask me again.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,You're still here. You're a dynamo.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,I can't believe I get paid for this.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,I'll see you tomorrow.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,How you doing?,12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,Hello.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Why is that?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Convulsing?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Convulsing?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"I don't know, I'm trying to help you.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,You don't drink.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,So you started drinking.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,So how was it?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Good thing the cleaning lady was there.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Dick was fired.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,What are you saying?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,I'm not saying anything.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,You're saying something.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,What could I be saying?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,If I was saying something I would have said it.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Well why don't you say it?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,I said it.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,What did you say?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Yeah?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,(over the speaker) It's George.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Come on up.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,No I didn't.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,How much did he save?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.",12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Did you tell her anything?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,No.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Do you swear?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Oh you told her didn't you.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,No.,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,"Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,What? Did I what?,12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,You did didn't you.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.",12,S03E12,3
ELAINE,Well Jerry told me that you did.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,This is for you.,12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,"Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.",12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,"Okay, okay, can I open it now?",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.,12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,Oh! Is that cashmere?,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Of course it's cashemere.,12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,Just a little something for Christmas.,12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,"When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.",12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.",12,S03E12,3
CLEANING WOMAN,"Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.",12,S03E12,3

CLEANING WOMAN,(noticing the dot) What's this?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.",12,S03E12,3
DICK,The only stench is comming from you.,12,S03E12,3

GEORGE,Who said that?,12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,She did.,12,S03E12,3
GEORGE,"Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",12,S03E12,3
MR. LIPPMAN,You're fired.,12,S03E12,3

DICK,(noticing the dot) What's this?,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,"But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.",12,S03E12,3
DICK,You mean on the wagon.,12,S03E12,3
JERRY,Don't get smart.,12,S03E12,3
KRAMER,"All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G.

GEORGE,"Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.",13,S03E13,3
WOMAN,I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.,13,S03E13,3

How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be?

Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable.

GEORGE,"No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,How do I get the hand?,14,S03E14,3

GEORGE,"Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.",14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,"Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"With all due respect, I don't think so...",14,S03E14,3

GEORGE,*No*...,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...",14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,They have a piano backstage they warm up on.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"*No*, we would have heard it.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!",14,S03E14,3

MOLLIKA,REally. ... You really look great.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?",14,S03E14,3
MOLLIKA,"Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.",14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,Have you thought about an intervention?,14,S03E14,3
MOLLIKA,What's that?,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.",14,S03E14,3
MOLLIKA,He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.,14,S03E14,3
ElainELAINE,"I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"I dunno, it was an impulse.",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,What kind of a sick impulse does that??,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,How could I know she would start to laugh?,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Can we just go in already?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,What are we gonna tell her?,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...",14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,What about?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Hey, hey! We're discussing something!",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"I know, but I'm distracted now.",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?",14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,He's good.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Uh, can we cut to the chase?",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"""Cut to the chase""?",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,Yeah...,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,A lot of people say it.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,I would lose that.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,[Accusingly] What's *that*?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Really, an intervention ...",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Y'know people, we got a situation over here!",14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Me? Why me?,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"All right, OK, I'm goin' in.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,We've got to talk about this (to Elaine),14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,All right.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,No..,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,You play a *Hell* of a piano.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,"Well then, what was she laughing at?",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Pez?,14,S03E14,3
NOEL,"Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Me, uh, uh, no, ...",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.,14,S03E14,3
NOEL,I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits],14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other),14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,I don't feel like it tonight.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,We'll be outside,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,Yeah,14,S03E14,3

JERRY,You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,What? How?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,So? What happened?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.",14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,Shut up!,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.,14,S03E14,3
ELAINE,Whar about Kramer?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,He's the same!,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?",14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,"(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.",14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,Can I get in on that?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,What do you think? It's like a poker game?,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,Is Elaine going?,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Yeah,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,"Well, I knew him as well as she did.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Yeah, but John invited her.",14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,"So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,It's George,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,Stop smelling your arm.,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea.""",14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,Tell me about it!,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,Well it's over. It's definitely over.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,She broke up with you?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,What was on the list?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,"Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said ""no, maybe we could get together for lunch."" You know what that means.",14,S03E14,3
JERRY,What's wrong with lunch?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,Break up with her,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,What?,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.,14,S03E14,3
JERRY,A preemptive breakup.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"So, I am have to going to break up with you.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,You're breaking up with me?,14,S03E14,3

NOEL,I thought everything was fine.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Well, live and learn.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,Kind of.,14,S03E14,3
NOEL,I'm very confused.,14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,"I thought,...",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,"Now, stop it ...",14,S03E14,3
NOEL,"What do you want, I can make you happy.",14,S03E14,3
GEORGE,When you're playing the piano do you think about me?,14,S03E14,3

KRAMER,"Oh, I'm talking about the beach.",14,S03E14,3
STEVE,What about it?,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,"You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.",14,S03E14,3
STEVE,That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,"Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?",14,S03E14,3
STEVE,Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.,14,S03E14,3
KRAMER,So you don't think it's a good idea?,14,S03E14,3
[The Intervention [NOTE,DOUBLE CHECK THIS PART FOR SURE!!!!],14,S03E14,3

GINA,A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,Hey.,15,S03E15,3

KRAMER,"What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?",15,S03E15,3

JERRY,I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.,15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,"There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.",15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,"Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.",15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.,15,S03E15,3

RULA,"George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.",15,S03E15,3

JERRY,You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.,15,S03E15,3
GINA,It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.",15,S03E15,3

KRAMER,"George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.",15,S03E15,3
JERRY,osh.,15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,Woah. (hitting George),15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,Wow! (hitting George),15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson,15,S03E15,3

JERRY,Oh! (hitting George),15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,Shes a sweet kid.,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!,15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,"Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.",15,S03E15,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,Yeah.,15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,Whats this?,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,They moved in together?,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"Yeah, its some place down in the village.",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,Phew.,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,Yeah.,15,S03E15,3
ELAINE,Its Elaine.,15,S03E15,3
JERRY,All right were coming down.,15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,"Hey, where ya going?",15,S03E15,3
JERRY,"Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?",15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,"Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.",15,S03E15,3
GEORGE,Elle McPherson going to be there?,15,S03E15,3
KRAMER,OH! I got to call her back.,15,S03E15,3
GEORGE,"Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, yes you will.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No, I won't.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Yeah, maybe you won't.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Are my nostrils getting bigger?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, ""Hi. I'm",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"There's just no men out there, you know?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,I know.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,I hate the good ones.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Is Jerry one of the good ones?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, ""Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?"" and eventually I just go, ""You're right.""",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, so there's still hope.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, so hopelessness is the key.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,It's my only hope.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Well, at least you're not bitter.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Who says I'm not bitter?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Aren't you too young to be bitter?,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,So what'd you do last night?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Went out with George, you?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Went out with Cynthia.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,How was it? What'd you talk about?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,George too.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY AND ELAINE (together),"Yeah, right.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I've never fixed anybody up.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Well you implied it.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,I didn't say it.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Who is he?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,He's George!,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,She's Cynthia!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,So what?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"What, you don't think she's beautiful?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I went out with you.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,He can really do that?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"What, are you into this?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Yeah, come on, it's a good match.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Naturally.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Everything.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,What if it worked out?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY (dialing),Yeah right.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Out of the question. Out of the question!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Why?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,She's good looking.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,How good looking?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Very good looking.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Really good looking?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Really very good looking.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Would you take her out?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Yes, I would take her out.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Oh, you hesitated.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No, something's off here, you hesitated.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"I'm telling you, she's good looking.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"What about the body, what kind of body?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Good body, nice body.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,How nice?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Nice.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Just nice?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Pretty nice.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Really good?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Really very nice and good.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,What about personality?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Good personality. Funny. Bright.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,How could she be smarter than you?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"First of all, what does he do?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,He's not working?! How come he's not working?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Well, um, he, he got fired.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Why did he get fired?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Excuse me?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Is he nuts?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,What does he look like?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Pardon?,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,What does he look like?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,He's bald?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,So he will be bald.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Yup.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,What kind of hair?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"You know, long dark hair.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Flowing?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Flowing?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Just clarifying.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,I'd like to be able to get it out.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I think you'll get it out.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,She's got a fine cheek.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Is there a pinkish hue?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,A pinkish hue?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Yes, a rosy glow.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Has he ever been married?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,No.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,Has he been close?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,He once spent a weekend with a woman.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,He didn't really try to poison his boss?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, he did.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I think it's tamber.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I didn't notice the voice.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,It's mellifluous!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"So, Saturday night.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Hi.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Hey! Saturday night!,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,I know!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"So, what did she say?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,She said you're getting together Saturday night!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,That's it?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Yeah!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,She didn't mention anything about the conversation?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,No.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,What?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,She could have mentioned the conversation.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,Hey.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Hey.,16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, the guy from Jersey?",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,What are you gonna do with all of them?,16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,I'll take one. It's possible.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,I think they went out to dinner.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, it's me, I just got home.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Remember our pact. Full disclosure.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"You can tell me, I'll vault it.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,It's in the vault?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I'm locking the vault. What?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,We had sex.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,At your apartment?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Yeah.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,She didn't stay over?,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Oh my god.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,So? How was it?,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"So, what did she have to say?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,What did he have to say?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,He said they had a good time.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Her too.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, good.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Anything else?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Nope. You?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Nope.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,You sure?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Yup. You?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Yeah.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Yeah. Okay then.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Alright. Goodnight.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Goodnight.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Well, I'm gonna do something about this.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,What are you gonna do?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I'm gonna call her.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No, don't call her.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"No, I'm calling her.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"No, Jerry, don't call.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"No, forget it, I'm gonna call.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,I don't want you to call.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,Give me the phone!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I'll just call her when you leave!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"You can't do that, it's none of your business!",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,It is so my business!,16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,But tell him to give me the--,16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,No.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Yeah, but--",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,But Kramer--,16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,What?,16,S03E16,3

KRAMER,Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!",16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,I missed my period.,16,S03E16,3

CYNTHIA,"I am very worried, I am never late.",16,S03E16,3

JERRY,So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Oh, I know her. I know her type.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Her type? What type?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,She's not bitter!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"Twisted? God, I did you a favor.",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Are you calling me a liar?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,"I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Are you?,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,Get your finger out of my face.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,"You get yours out, I was here first!",16,S03E16,3
JERRY,I don't care.,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Get it out!,16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,I knew those condoms were defective!,16,S03E16,3
JERRY,How did you know they were defective?!,16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Because! Because she missed her period!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.,16,S03E16,3
CYNTHIA,"I said to him, ""I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."" And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--",16,S03E16,3
ELAINE,Hi!,16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.",16,S03E16,3

ELAINE,"Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.",16,S03E16,3
GEORGE,"(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.",16,S03E16,3
KRAMER,"Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.",17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.",17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Oh I'm a chucker.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.",17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,You chuck.,17,S03E17,3
GEROGE,Kramer am I a chucker?,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,You're a chucker.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Believe me I didn't see anything.,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"No, did you?",17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, I snuck a peak.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Why?,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,Why not? hey what about you George?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,All right,17,S03E17,3

JERRY,All right,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,See ya.,17,S03E17,3

GEORGE,"Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.",17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"Hey, should we say something to him?",17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.,17,S03E17,3

GEORGE,"What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.",17,S03E17,3

JERRY,Really?,17,S03E17,3

JERRY,What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Mine too.,17,S03E17,3
KEITH,I love that bit about Jimmy Olson,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Thank you.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...",17,S03E17,3
KEITH,(to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.",17,S03E17,3
KEITH,"You know, I live on the East Side.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.",17,S03E17,3
KEITH,or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Oh. that would be great.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"Uh, it's only a matter of time.",17,S03E17,3

ELAINE,Well maybe you should call him.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I can't ... I can't,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Why not?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I don't know. I just feel he should call me.,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,What's the difference?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,"Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,I'm sorry honey.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,"No,",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,I know.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Why don't you just go ahead and call him?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Just ask him if he wants a to get together.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,For what dinner?,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Dinner's good.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, He's A GUY!",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,... this is all .. very confusing.,17,S03E17,3
MRS. SOKOL,You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.,17,S03E17,3
MRS. SOKOL,So where have you been looking for work?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.",17,S03E17,3

KRAMER,What guy?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.,17,S03E17,3

GEORGE,"No, no! You can't throw me out",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Hellooo Newman.,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.,17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,I despise him.,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Why?,17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,Why? I'll tell you why...,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,Let me tell it ..,17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,"No, you can't tell it ..",17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,You always tell it ..,17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,"All right, tell it.",17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,Ja ja ja - just tell it,17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,"June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.",17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, "" Nice game pretty boy."". Keith continued past us up the ramp.",17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,"A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.",17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,What was it?,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"He spit on us.... and I screamed out, ""I'm hit!""",17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Wow! What a story.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,"Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.",17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,Well that's the way it happened.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,What happened to your head when you got hit?,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Again,17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,Back and to the left,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Back and to the left Back and to the left,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,"So, what are you saying?",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,But that is not what they would have you believe.,17,S03E17,3
NEWMAN,I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits),17,S03E17,3
KRAMER,"Wait, wait, (Exits)",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,(Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,No. What happened to you?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,"Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer ""Vandelay Industries"".",17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I'm Vandelay Industries?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Right.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,And what is that?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,You're in latex,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,Latex? And what do I do with latex?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Ya manufacture it.,17,S03E17,3
ELAINE,Here in this little apartment?,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,And what do I say about you?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.,17,S03E17,3
JERRY,I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?,17,S03E17,3
GEORGE,Right.,17,S03E17,3

KEITH,"Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.",18,S03E18,3
JERRY,Is there a box spring?,18,S03E18,3
KEITH,What's that?,18,S03E18,3

JERRY,Is that a sectional?,18,S03E18,3
KEITH,Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> coffee table.,18,S03E18,3
JERRY,Is that a thick marble?,18,S03E18,3
KEITH,Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.,18,S03E18,3
JERRY,STAIRS??? There's no elevator?,18,S03E18,3
KEITH,"Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.",18,S03E18,3

KRAMER,"No no no, well, then who was it?",18,S03E18,3
KEITH,"Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road.  Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.",18,S03E18,3
JERRY,I told you!,18,S03E18,3
NEWMAN,"Wow, it was McDowell.",18,S03E18,3
JERRY,But why? Why McDowell?,18,S03E18,3
KRAMER,"Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.",18,S03E18,3
NEWMAN,He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.,18,S03E18,3
NEWMAN,It was McDowell.,18,S03E18,3
KRAMER,"Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.",18,S03E18,3

JERRY,"It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,"First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,Well you should have been O'Brien.,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?,19,S03E19,3

GEORGE,"Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of ""The Big Game"".",19,S03E19,3
EVA,"Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.",19,S03E19,3
TIM,"Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.",19,S03E19,3
JERRY,He tends to exaggerate.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"Okay, I mean it's serious but--",19,S03E19,3
EVA,We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.,19,S03E19,3

ELAINE,Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,He did.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,I don't know.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.",19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,"You're not going to open with that, are you?",19,S03E19,3

JERRY,Nice looking Lugar.,19,S03E19,3
JODI,"I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.",19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?",19,S03E19,3

DAN,"Oh, Kramer?",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,What's going on?,19,S03E19,3
DAN,"Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.",19,S03E19,3
DAN,"Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.",19,S03E19,3
DAN,"Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.",19,S03E19,3

GEORGE,"I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.",19,S03E19,3
JERRY,How'd that happen?,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,"I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.",19,S03E19,3
TIM,We'll be ready in a minute.,19,S03E19,3

TIM,You are.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,Good. I think you forgot something.,19,S03E19,3
TIM,I'm sorry.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,Good. Now get out.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"Okay, what are we gonna do?",19,S03E19,3
JERRY,I don't know.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.",19,S03E19,3
JERRY,Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,I'm sure he was just joking around.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,What is it?,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,Jerry's a nazi?!,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,I can't believe I didn't see it.,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.",19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,You don't think so.,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"No, he's just neat.",19,S03E19,3
TIM,You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,Me??,19,S03E19,3
TIM,And you really don't look like a Murphy.,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.,19,S03E19,3
TIM,Where are you from?,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,"Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.",19,S03E19,3
TIM,Sounds more like Scottish.,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,We were right on the border.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,Maybe he's with the company.,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,What?,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,What about his comedy act?,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,What about George?,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,I'll bet they were even in on it.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"Kramer, you're hurting me!",19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,"Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,Get off of me!!,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,O'Brien.,19,S03E19,3
MAN #1,O'Brien? Is that him?,19,S03E19,3
MAN #2,"Yeah, that's him.",19,S03E19,3
MAN #3,Look there's O'Brien!,19,S03E19,3
MAN #4,Filthy nazi bastard!,19,S03E19,3
ALL FOUR MEN,Let's get him!!,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,What do I do?! What do I do?!,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,Get in the car! Get in the car!,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,"(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?",19,S03E19,3
TIM,Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?,19,S03E19,3
JERRY,"No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.",19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,It could be very confusing.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,Yeah? Eva?,19,S03E19,3
EVA,It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.,19,S03E19,3
KRAMER,O'Brien? Well that's weird.,19,S03E19,3
EVA,(gun drawn) Who are you?,19,S03E19,3
JODI,"A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.",19,S03E19,3
JODI,"They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.",19,S03E19,3
EVA,Get out!!,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!",19,S03E19,3
DAN,Elaine?,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,Hey!,19,S03E19,3
GEORGE,I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!,19,S03E19,3
ELAINE,"You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Oh look at this guy.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What's goin' on?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Did you get a thank you wave?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Give me that wave!,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, are you free on Friday?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Yeah, I'm free, why?",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,You gotta follow that car!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,You can't let him get away with that!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"What are you, yellow?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice),20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Wait, he stopped, he's parking.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Let's not even analyze it.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,So you didn't turn her in?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Gonna see her again?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Friday night.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Yep.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,It's me!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Come on up.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! I dig.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh, you dig?",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Yes! I see enormous potential here.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Why?,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,I don't think so.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"What am I drinking, milk?",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Hey!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Hi.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Sweater.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Thank you.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,So? What happened?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,With that?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,With the car!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What car?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,The hit and run!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand),20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Yeah, Queens.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,So? Then what?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!"" So he says to me, ""What are ya gonna do about it?""",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary.""",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,I am speechless. I am without speech.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Tell her about the shoving.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What shoving?!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh, it was nothing.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,No! Tell her.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,You know karate??,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,I know a little.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,Hey! (Group does likewise),20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Did you tell Kramer?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,What? What? What? Tell me.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,"Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,They should be sent to Australia.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Australia?,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,But not anymore.,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,No.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, Kramer!",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,Yeah?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead),20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,I don't know!,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,"You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Well, that is, that is strange.",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,Yep. (Mumbles off),20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed),20,S03E20,3
JERRY,We just met.,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"But I, I can't go alone!",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Ask George to go with you.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"George, come on! I'll pay for you.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,You'll pay? I'm there.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Why do you even need anybody?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)",20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,You went out with a bullfighter?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.",20,S03E20,3
MICHAEL,Wow.,20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,What was his name?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Pass the salt please.,20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,Where did you meet him?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Bread.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,God bless you.,20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,Thank you.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)",20,S03E20,3
WOMAN,You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.",20,S03E20,3
WOMAN,Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.,20,S03E20,3
WOMAN,Come here. (moves in for a kiss),20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Really, I was, I was only kidding around.",20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,He was only joking Michael.,20,S03E20,3
MICHAEL,You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.",20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,He was only joking Michael! Sorry.,20,S03E20,3
MICHAEL,All right! Take his side!,20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,I am not taking his side.,20,S03E20,3
MICHAEL,Well who's side are you taking?!,20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,Well I'm not taking your side!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,It's me.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Come on up.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What if she's having an off night?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Hi!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Hi.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Ah, shut up.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,A stupid what?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Whatever.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Who?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Robin!,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Why?!,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Entertainment Tonight's on.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Where's the remote phone?,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Bedroom.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What's it like out?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Chilly out.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Can I take a sweater?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Scarf?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What's the matter? What's going on?,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,What happened?!,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What?,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,I think I hit my head again!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What is wrong?!,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,Yeah.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,That is it!,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,What?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!",20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,Mary Hart!,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,God.,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,What?,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Get together?,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Maybe she just wants to talk to me?,20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Are you actually considering this?,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Yeah.,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,"Hey, you know who owns that car?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,What car?,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Yeah who?,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,"That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.",20,S03E20,3
ELAINE,Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.,20,S03E20,3
KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,The blond with the blue sweatpants!,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Well, who is she?",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,"Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,You can't compromise your principles!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,How am I going to live with myself?!,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Can't live!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,This country needs more people like you!,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.",20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,I believe strongly in that as you know.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,There should be more people like us.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,That's why the world's in the shape it's in.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,You're telling me.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.",20,S03E20,3
BECKY,Well God bless you.,20,S03E20,3
JERRY,Thank you very much.,20,S03E20,3
GEORGE,Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?,20,S03E20,3
ROBIN,"Oh no, what's wrong?",20,S03E20,3

ELAINE,"Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.",20,S03E20,3
JERRY,"Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!",20,S03E20,3

ELAINE,I'll pay for it.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!",22,S03E22,3

ELAINE,You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Will you just park it already?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No no no, he's not getting away with this.",22,S03E22,3

GEORGE,"Hey, what are you doing?",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,I think I'm parking my car.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,I was in the middle of a conversation.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,The point is I was here first.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,I was closer to this space than you were.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,I can if I have room!,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Are you gonna move the car?,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"No, I'm not gonna move the car.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Jerk!,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Oh, you're not?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Do you believe this guy?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Come on, we'll put it in a garage.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Are you coming back down?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Oh, come on, you're good at this.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,What am I gonna say?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Yeah, under the counter. What happened?",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,He is?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,A gun?!,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"My god, are you okay?",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Exactly.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Where's George now?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,What are you talking about?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Look out the window, you'll see.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Hey!,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Are you okay?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm fine.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Crazy kids, huh?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,What?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Is that Jerry? Jerry?!,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Oh, hey Mike.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"What, you know Jerry?",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Yeah, I know Jerry.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,How do you know him?,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,What's the difference?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,I'm coming down.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"What, you know Kramer?!",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Hi.,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,(acting standoffish) Hello.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Yeah.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Oh great.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,You know that guy downstairs?,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Yeah, he's a real phony.",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,What's going on?!,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,It's my space!,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,I'll be down in a minute.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Are you going down?,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,Yeah.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Is anything wrong?,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,I'll die out here.,22,S03E22,3
BYSTANDER #1,"He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.",22,S03E22,3
BYSTANDER #2,"No, it doesn't matter. He was-",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Hey Krame! You know this guy?,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I know him.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Oh, come on.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,You've got a prayer.,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,I go in front first all the time.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Did you talk to him?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, it's all taken care of.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,You told him? What did you tell him?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"I don't believe it, what did you say?",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,A pack of teenagers?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"You are a genius, it's as simple as that.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,What?,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Oh great.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,I didn't know.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,A flea market? You went to a flea market??,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Hey, who's talking to you?",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,We just didn't think of you.,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"You said it, sister.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,You're right. My fault.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm sorry.",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,It was a so-so sorry.,22,S03E22,3
TRUCK DRIVER,"Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?,22,S03E22,3
TRUCK DRIVER,Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Wild pack of teenagers, huh?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Yeah.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Uh huh.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Right.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,I learned a lot about myself.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,What did you do to my car?!,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,I thought you said you were a good driver!,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,I think you said driver.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Will you move it up a little bit?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No no no, that's in the right position.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"No no, I was further in.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Do you mind?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Do you?,22,S03E22,3
SID,"Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Hey Sid.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Who are you?,22,S03E22,3
SID,"Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Sid, it's completely his fault.",22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Oh, right.",22,S03E22,3
SID,Why don't you start taking the bus?,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,Don't do it!,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Why don't you just flip a coin already?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,So you're against me now?,22,S03E22,3
ANGRY MAN,"He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.",22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,"No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.",22,S03E22,3
ANGRY MAN,No he wasn't.,22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,All that matters is who was there first.,22,S03E22,3
ANGRY MAN,"Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.",22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,You just spit on me!,22,S03E22,3
ANGRY MAN,Don't you raise your voice to me!,22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,You're not my father.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Hey Matthew.,22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,How ya doing?,22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,Okay.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.",22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,What?!,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Oh no, nothing.",22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?,22,S03E22,3

MARYEDITH,Jerry?! What's the matter with you?,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,I didn't--,22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,"(to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"Oh, congratulations.",22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,What for?,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,"Well, you're pregnant.",22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,What?,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,You're not pregnant?,22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,"No, I'm not pregnant.",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,Are you sure you're not pregnant?,22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,"Yes, I'm sure!",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,That's weird.,22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,"Come on, Matthew.",22,S03E22,3
MATTHEW,No.,22,S03E22,3
MARYEDITH,"Come on, Matthew!",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,I thought she was pregnant.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,What?,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Mike thinks I'm a phony.,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,He thinks you're a phony?,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,"Oh, you have to say something.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,You gotta open the vault.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Open my vault?,22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,Open your vault.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,"Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.",22,S03E22,3
ELAINE,You have no choice.,22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Oy ga-vault.,22,S03E22,3
Newman,(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.,22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,When can you park head first?,22,S03E22,3
NEWMAN,Never.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,What are you asking this guy for?,22,S03E22,3
NEWMAN,Who's talking to you?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,He's right. never.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?,22,S03E22,3
NEWMAN,"Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.",22,S03E22,3

GEORGE,Oh please.,22,S03E22,3
SHEILA,What's going on here?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.",22,S03E22,3

GEORGE,"Well, thank you for your support.",22,S03E22,3
SHEILA,"Hey, that's a great hat.",22,S03E22,3

NEWMAN,"Hey George, nice hat.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, thanks.",22,S03E22,3
NEWMAN,Can I try it on?,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.",22,S03E22,3
NEWMAN,Well sure it would.,22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No! Get out of here, Newman.",22,S03E22,3
NEWMAN,"Come on, let me try it on.",22,S03E22,3
GEORGE,"No, Newman, stop it.",22,S03E22,3
SHEILA,Let him try it on.,22,S03E22,3

KRAMER,"No. Don't, Jerry.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Like you didn't call me a phony?,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.",22,S03E22,3
JERRY,Use it in a sentence.,22,S03E22,3
MIKE,"Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?",22,S03E22,3
KRAMER,He begged me.,22,S03E22,3

COP #1,"Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head",22,S03E22,3

REFEREE,Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*,22,S03E22,3
Jerry's stand-up,"So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) ""Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again."" They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system...""Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment."" You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet ""hide-a-key"" under the wing...""maybe he left it up there somewhere...""",23,S03E23,3
Opening scene,Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY's brain,"What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY's brain,What the hell...? Why is the door open?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Kramer, what are you doing here!?",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,You scared me!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,It's just me.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,That's enough!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY (from outside the door),C'mon...c'mon...,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Kramer! What are you doing?!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,What does it look like I'm doing? What?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Alright, alright...",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,C'mon!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Sorry.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Move it! Move it! Get going!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY (from inside the bathroom),Is that my towel?,23,S03E23,3
GIRLFRIEND,I'm really happy the movie was sold out.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?",23,S03E23,3
GIRLFRIEND,"I'm from Witchita, so...",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.),23,S03E23,3
GIRLFRIEND,"Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.),23,S03E23,3
GIRLFRIEND,That was close!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Did you see the look on that guy's face?,23,S03E23,3
GIRLFRIEND,"You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,What?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Oh, come on!",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"No, come on!",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"What, what, I thought you went to the movies!",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,It was sold out!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,That's the point.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,What point?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Just, look, just give the keys.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Just give me another chance!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Don't ask me!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,I'm asking you!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,I'm telling you.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,You're joking.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,I'm serious!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,It's not going to happen again!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Yes it will, now give me those keys!",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (getting up),"O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,So put 'em in a safe place.,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,I will.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Where?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,I can't.,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE (mouths the words),Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.),23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Who's there?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (in hallway),"Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"Oh, I'm not, uh...",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of the keys.""",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"Jerry, give him the keys back.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Elaine...,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Take the keys.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,O.K.!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Your spare set?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,That's right.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,You want 'em back?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Well, you can get 'em back.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,I suppose I could.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Me?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)",23,S03E23,3
WAITRESS,"Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George),Do you ever yearn?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Yearn? Do I yearn?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,I yearn.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,You yearn.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (in disgust),Look at you.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Aw, Kramer, don't start...",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (moving back to the othe side of the booth),You're wasting your life.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,No.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,You got money?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,No.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Do you have a woman?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,No.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Do you have any prospects?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,No.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,You got anything on the horizon?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Uh...no.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Do you have any action at all?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,No.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,I like to get the Daily News!,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Why?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one line! You got fired!",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Uh, no, I'm not.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"You're not really gonna go to California, are you?",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (points to his head),"Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother.""",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,That's ridiculous.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE (shakes huge keyring),That's Kramer.,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,What for?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Jerry? Why?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,'Cause he gave me his.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,So what?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"So, if he has my keys, I should have his.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,I just said the same thing to you.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,What?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,What?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Did you bring the keys?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,This could be an emergency!,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,You never should have taken away his keys!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,How'd the Mets do?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,They lost.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Kramer?,23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN (startling them),"Hello, boys.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Hello, Newman.",23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,You lookin' for someone?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!",23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,Coy? I'm not being coy.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY (to George),Is he being coy?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Yeah, coy.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?",23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN (coyly),Who?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!",23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,"Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Turn around, George.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Sure. (Turns around.),23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,George?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)",23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,Help! Help!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Where's Kramer?,23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,HELP! (Elaine enters.),23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,What's going on?,23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,They're gonna beat me up!,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,No we're not.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.,23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,"You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Bad rap?,23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,Yeah. From you.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Me?,23,S03E23,3
NEWMAN,You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,L.A.?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Huh?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,What...?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"No, what'd you say?",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,Nothing. I didn't say anything.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Oh, you didn't see it.",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"I heard you say something, there.",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,I didn't say anything.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Ask her about Kramer.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,She's drunk out of her mind.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine),"Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine),Hey! You ever been in an accident?,23,S03E23,3
BIKER,"About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY (applauding),"Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Don't feel right? What are you talking about?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,What is the big deal?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Nope, no can do.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Do you wanna fight?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Do you wanna fight?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.),23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.",23,S03E23,3
HIPPIE #1,"Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.",23,S03E23,3
HIPPIE #1,"Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Oh, he's cold.",23,S03E23,3
HIPPIE #1,"Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!",23,S03E23,3
HIPPIE #1,"Hey, what's the rush, man?",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.",23,S03E23,3
HIPPIE #1,"Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)",23,S03E23,3
HIPPIE #2,"Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,What's that?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Nothing.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,I heard something.,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.),23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"So, how long you been drivin' this thing?",23,S03E23,3
WOMAN,Goin' on four years.,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.",23,S03E23,3
WOMAN,"Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.",23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,"You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.",23,S03E23,3
WOMAN,You want to give it a try?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Really?,23,S03E23,3
WOMAN,Do you know how to double-clutch?,23,S03E23,3
KRAMER,Yeah.,23,S03E23,3
WOMAN,"Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Well, this is great.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Well, what do they look like?",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) ""What do they look like.""",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Well, they're obviously not here.",23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,"Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!",23,S03E23,3
JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk),"What is this? ""Murphy Brown""?",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,What?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,By Elaine Benes?,23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,What?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.),23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.),23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Gimme half!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"All right, here!",23,S03E23,3
GEORGE,Why didn't she tell us?,23,S03E23,3
JERRY (making fun),Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.),23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,You weasels!,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,What? What?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,How dare you!,23,S03E23,3

ELAINE,I just thought I could write it.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,Is that something you want to do?,23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.,23,S03E23,3
JERRY,"Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.",23,S03E23,3
ELAINE,"O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.",23,S03E23,3

GEORGE,"Yeah, I turned him down.",1,S04E01,4
JERRY,How come you didn't tell me?,1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,He asked me to keep it a secret.,1,S04E01,4
JERRY,But you can never keep a secret.,1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.,1,S04E01,4
JERRY,"Well, you've come a long way.",1,S04E01,4

GEORGE,A free ticket?,1,S04E01,4

JERRY,All taken care of.,1,S04E01,4

They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...",1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.",1,S04E01,4
STUDIO GUARD,"Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?",1,S04E01,4

HELENA,"It was a Three Stooges short, ""Sappy Pappy."" I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?",1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?",1,S04E01,4
HELENA,"No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.",1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"Uh huh, right.",1,S04E01,4
HELENA,"But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.",1,S04E01,4

HELENA,I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.,1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.",1,S04E01,4
HELENA,"Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.",1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.",1,S04E01,4
HELENA,"Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?",1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?",1,S04E01,4
HELENA,"Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,",1,S04E01,4
KRAMER,"Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.",1,S04E01,4

JERRY,Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.,1,S04E01,4

LUPE,"Oh, yes, yes.",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,"Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.",1,S04E01,4
LUPE,"Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.",1,S04E01,4

GEORGE,"...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.",1,S04E01,4
CORBIN BERNSEN,Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?,1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,"Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.",1,S04E01,4
CORBIN BERNSEN,So you killed the cat.,1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,"That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.,1,S04E01,4
GEORGE WENDT,"Oh, of course not.",1,S04E01,4

GEORGE WENDT,"Yeah, well.",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,"Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE WENDT,"Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,"Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE WENDT,"Well yeah, they do, heh heh.",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE,What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.,1,S04E01,4

CORBIN BERNSEN,"Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.",1,S04E01,4
HELENA,"He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.",1,S04E01,4
GEORGE WENDT,"It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.",1,S04E01,4
THE FREAK,"So that's when I said, ""Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?"" And he said, ""What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?",1,S04E01,4

JERRY,"I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!",2,S04E02,4
GEORGE,"I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.",2,S04E02,4
JERRY,You should've had some eggs.,2,S04E02,4
GEORGE,For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?,2,S04E02,4

JERRY,Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?,3,S04E03,4

NEWMAN,"Nevertheless, ...",3,S04E03,4

JERRY,Right.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.",3,S04E03,4

JERRY,"They say, ""What's your show about?"" I say, ""Nothing.""",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,There you go.,3,S04E03,4

JERRY,Why not?,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,well it just doesn't sit well.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,"That's your problem, buddy.",3,S04E03,4

KRAMER,Yeah. That's strange.,3,S04E03,4
NEWMAN,"A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.",3,S04E03,4

JERRY,"(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.",3,S04E03,4
RECEPTIONIST,"Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.",3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,I'll call back.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?,3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Is it with a ""y""?",3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,No.,3,S04E03,4
SUSAN,What's the premise?,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.",3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,You read? You read on the show?,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.",3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,"All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Oh, no. No stories.",3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,"No stories? So, what is it?",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,(Showing an example) What'd you do today?,3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,I got up and came to work.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,There's a show. That's a show.,3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,(Confused) How is that a show?,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"No, no, no. Nothing happens.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Well, something happens.",3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,"Well, why am I watching it?",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,Because it's on TV.,3,S04E03,4
RUSSELL,(Threatening) Not yet.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,(To Russell) How about this I manage a circus..,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,Wait a minute let me call Susan.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"No, no this is more important.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,She might be leaving to work any minute.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,No.,3,S04E03,4
ELAINE,What is it?,3,S04E03,4
DR. RESTON,I was just thinking about this patient of mine.,3,S04E03,4
ELAINE,What?,3,S04E03,4
DR. RESTON,Just wondering if he's taking his medication.,3,S04E03,4
ELAINE,"Well, come on we're on vacation.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,Yeah (to buzzer),3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,(OC) It's George.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,"Whoa, back up a second.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,Why would you think I would invite him?,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"I just a ssumed, ...",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,Of course. How are you?,3,S04E03,4
SUSAN,"Fine, it's good to see you.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,And this is Kramer.,3,S04E03,4
SUSAN,Hello.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"All right go ahead Susan, tell him.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,Tell me what?,3,S04E03,4
SUSAN,"Well, I, (phone rings)",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.",3,S04E03,4
TEL,"Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.",3,S04E03,4
TEL,"Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.",3,S04E03,4
TEL,No.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up),3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Well, go ahead, tell him.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Kramer, are you drinking that milk?",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,Yeah.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,What's the expiration date on that?,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,September third.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,The third?,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,and SUSAN The third?,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,"Um, Uh, ugh, ...",3,S04E03,4
SUSAN,Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan),3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,I think SHE saw it coming.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,"Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,What happened to you?,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,Devola came after me.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,"Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, ""That's what I thin k of your party.""",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Boy, that is some kick.",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,"Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.",3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Wow, Newman's helmet.",3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,Holly.,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,"Me, why?",3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,He doesn't like you.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.,3,S04E03,4
KRAMER,Pass the cream.,3,S04E03,4
GEORGE,Wait a second. (smells it). all right.,3,S04E03,4
JERRY,(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,What are you looking for?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"No, no, no.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"All right, what is this?",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,(clueless) what is what?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"All right, very funny. I get it.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,You're in a weird mood.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Fix what?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Your pants!,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Go look at your face in the mirror.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Wha-huh-wha-huh...,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,(pressing intercom) yeah?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,(on intercom) It's George.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Come on up.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,I don't believe this.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"No, I swear.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Me?,4,S04E04,4

JERRY,From that woman at NBC?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Yeah.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,A dry-cleaning bill for what?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,For vomiting on her vest!,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,(pointing Kramer) He drank it.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,I didn't know.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Yeah.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,How much was it to clean the vest?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Eighteen dollars.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Can you get vomit out of suede?,4,S04E04,4

JERRY,You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,What's Yo-yo Ma?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,I know!,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Jeez!,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Anyway.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it.

JERRY,"Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.',4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Oh!,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"You know, I think he wears a piece.",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"What, is that the one your parents gave you?",4,S04E04,4

GEORGE,"All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,I'll pay for it.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,It's not the money!,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?",4,S04E04,4
LEO,Jerry!,4,S04E04,4

JERRY,"Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.",4,S04E04,4
LEO,You know where I just came from?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.",4,S04E04,4
LEO,He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.",4,S04E04,4
LEO,"The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'",4,S04E04,4

NEWMAN,"Come on, are you ready? Let's go!",4,S04E04,4

NEWMAN,"You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"Well, I can't!",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Shut up! I'll get my coat!,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Don't step on anything.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Look at this.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Why didn't you shave this morning?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Why?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Because of the day before. It's a long story.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Is that Joe Davola?,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,It's not him!,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.,4,S04E04,4
Receptionist,Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Oh.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Okay. A little.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"Okay, you're all set? You got your story?",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,No.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,Uhm...,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,I never had an air conditioner.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,No! That's no reason to kill yourself!,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,I was never able to become a banker.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,You must be banker.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,MUST be banker.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN (satisfied),"Okay, we'll go with the banker story.",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.,4,S04E04,4
RUSSEL,And people really have to care about the characters.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Wouldn't tune in.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Would they tune in?,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,No tune.,4,S04E04,4
RUSSEL,We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,The show will be like a heart attack!,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,Just a huge massive coronary.,4,S04E04,4
RUSSEL,"So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.",4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,He couldn't believe it.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'",4,S04E04,4
Police officer,"Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.",4,S04E04,4
JUDGE,And then what happened?,4,S04E04,4
Police officer,"Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'",4,S04E04,4
RUSSEL,Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,"Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.",4,S04E04,4
JERRY,We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.,4,S04E04,4
GEORGE,Yeah!,4,S04E04,4

NEWMAN,I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.,4,S04E04,4
JUDGE,I don't understand.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.",4,S04E04,4
JUDGE,So then he didn't kill himself.,4,S04E04,4

GEORGE,I offered to pay. She should've said no.,4,S04E04,4
JERRY,"She did, you insisted.",4,S04E04,4

NEWMAN,Okay.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.,4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,"(not convincing) Uh, yeah.",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...",4,S04E04,4
JUDGE,Mister Newman.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.",4,S04E04,4
JUDGE,"Uh, continue.",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"As you were saying, Mister Kramer...",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,What was the question?,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.,4,S04E04,4

NEWMAN,"But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?",4,S04E04,4
KRAMER,I don't know.,4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?,4,S04E04,4
JUDGE,"Uh, could you get to the speeding?",4,S04E04,4
NEWMAN,"Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?",4,S04E04,4

COP,"Well, you're just gonna have to wait.",4,S04E04,4

"(The episode opens with a series of clips from 'The Pitch', 'The Ticket' and 'TheWallet', illustrating the story so far. A rough precis would be","George turns down the offer from NBC for the show, telling Jerry he's negotiating. Susan gives George a box of Cuban cigars from her father, which hepasses to Kramer, who sets fire to his hair while lighting one. Jerry's parents come to town, so's Morty can see a back specialist - he slept on the fold-out. Kramer tells Jerry's parents that Crazy Joe Davola is after Jerry. Jerry throws away a watch his parents gave him, because it doesn't keep time. Uncle Leo fetches it out of the garbage. Jerry tells his parents his watch is at the jeweller for repair. At the doctor's, Morty reveals his hatred of velcro and his wallet disappears. Elaine returns from Europe, eager to rid herself of the 'Svenjolly' Dr Reston. George tells her to inform the doctor she's seeing someone else. Elaine opts to say she's seeing Kramer, and Dr Reston wants to meet him.)",6,S04E06,4

There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, ""I refuse to put any thought into this at all.""

JERRY,"...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, ""Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now."" ""This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration."" You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) ""Here's fifty-six people that know me."" Cop goes. ""Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check.""",6,S04E06,4
JERRY,"Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go ""Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you.""",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,Well this is it.,7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,"Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.",7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,"Yeah, me too.",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.",7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,"(laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"No, I mean, I don't think so.",7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.,7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.",7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,Ahahahahahahahahaha.,7,S04E07,4
JERRY,That's not funny Naomi.,7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry),7,S04E07,4

GEORGE,"(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?",7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,"(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand),7,S04E07,4
NAOMI,"You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. ""I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa "" Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?,7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?,7,S04E07,4
JERRY,Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!,7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,"Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.",7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,"What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.",7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.",7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.,7,S04E07,4
JERRY,"Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.",7,S04E07,4

KRAMER,"Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.",7,S04E07,4

MEL,"(in tears) Excuse me, I ah ...",7,S04E07,4
ELAINE,Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself),7,S04E07,4
MEL,"Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV.",7,S04E07,4

SUSAN,Oh.,7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?,7,S04E07,4

JERRY,What's he doing? What is his hurry?,7,S04E07,4
ELAINE,Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.,7,S04E07,4

ELAINE,"Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.",7,S04E07,4

SUSAN,We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!,7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?,7,S04E07,4

GEORGE,"It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.",7,S04E07,4

SUSAN,So what? You are SUCH a prude.,7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,"Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)",7,S04E07,4
SUSAN,"Okay, Come on lets go in.",7,S04E07,4

SUSAN,What's the matter?,7,S04E07,4
GEORGE,I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.,7,S04E07,4
SUSAN,"Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.",7,S04E07,4

WAITRESS,How ?bout you?,7,S04E07,4
ELAINE,"Um, I'll just have a glass of water.",7,S04E07,4

ELAINE,Why not? That's all I want.,7,S04E07,4

Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?",8,S04E08,4

ELAINE,"(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!",8,S04E08,4

GEORGE,"Kramer, please.",8,S04E08,4
KRAMER,"Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.",8,S04E08,4

[Setting,Jerry's apartment],8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!",8,S04E08,4
ELAINE,(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?",8,S04E08,4
ELAINE,(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) ""Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone."" (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out ""Just go"" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in.

SUSAN,Uhh.. about the cabin..,8,S04E08,4
MR. ROSS,"(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) ""Cherish the cabin."" Not, uh, ""Take care of your sister."" (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, ""Cherish the cabin."" (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.",8,S04E08,4

SUSAN,"Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,(Extremely blunt) Burned.,8,S04E08,4
MR. ROSS,Burned?,8,S04E08,4
SUSAN,"There was a fire, and it uh..",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,Burned.,8,S04E08,4
MR. ROSS,(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..",8,S04E08,4
MRS. ROSS,(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her),8,S04E08,4
MR. ROSS,Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?,8,S04E08,4
SUSAN,(Solemn) No. Nothing.,8,S04E08,4
MRS. ROSS,"(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.",8,S04E08,4

SANDRA,(Offended) I can't believe you said that!,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,What?!,8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,(Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!,8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,That was a weird thing to say.,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.,8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,"Ohh, I think you're really sick.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.,8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path),8,S04E08,4
JERRY,I really think you're making too much of this.,8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,(Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door),8,S04E08,4
JERRY,Let me walk you to a cab.,8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,(Opens the door) That's ok.,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.",8,S04E08,4
SANDRA,"Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.",8,S04E08,4
[Setting,The Coffee shop],8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,Wo-hoah! What did you do?,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, right.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, ""That hand should not be on my leg."" But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, ""Would you mind?!""",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Alright, so, go ahead.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,So we go back to my apartment..,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,Typical things.,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,..And then she starts talking about her panties.,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,So I said something.,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Ok, what did you say?",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,Of course.,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?""",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) ""The panties your mother laid out for you""? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Well, how did she react?",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,She flipped out! Just left.,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?",8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,I guess he failed to see the humor in it.,8,S04E08,4
GEORGE,"Huh. (Makes a ""over his head"" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.",8,S04E08,4
JERRY,"(Getting up) Alright, big work day.",8,S04E08,4

GEORGE,"(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.",8,S04E08,4

ELAINE,Why? What happened? Did you talk?,8,S04E08,4
JERRY,Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.,8,S04E08,4

How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, ""What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!""",9,S04E09,4

JERRY,"Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?",9,S04E09,4
KRAMER,Some nut in a clown suit!,9,S04E09,4
JERRY,"I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.",9,S04E09,4
JERRY,We're dead.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,We're not dead.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,We are dead.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,So we'll do it tomorrow.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,About six years ago.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Women like skiers.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Yeah. Right.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,The closet business? What's the closet business?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What is it your business?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,I'm interested.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Yeah.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Yeah. So what happened?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"George, Marla.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Marla.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"George. Jerry, Stacey.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Stacey.,10,S04E10,4
STACEY,Jerry.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"George, Stacey.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Stacey.,10,S04E10,4
STACEY,George.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,George.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey),10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"So, how was your trip to Berlin?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Trip to Berlin?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, right, right.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains out?""",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"You, know my boyfriend went.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Really?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, did he like it?",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar),10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.",10,S04E10,4
STACEY,"Wow, what a great job. A writer.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Not a bad way to make a buck.,10,S04E10,4
STACEY,Sounds great.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"So, are you gonna go out with her?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,I might.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What about Susan?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Depends.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Depends on what?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,On many factors.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Like what?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Implied.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,She got anything in your medicine cabinet?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,There might be some moisturizer.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,(Pause) Yeah.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,What?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,You got yourself a girlfriend.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,You're going to make a good father someday.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"No, what?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Why? What do you mean?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Oh, right. Oh no, man.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,This is your plan?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"No, no. I'm just thinking.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I don't think you are.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Let me tell you what I think.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Are you very fussy about your pants?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I don't think I am.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Try me.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Everything?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Hey.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What are you doing?,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,No.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,What?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,This is not a good time.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Five minutes. What?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What did you have to give your TV away to George for?,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"Well, wow.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Marla, Kramer.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Hey.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Why don't you go out? It's nice out.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,There's weather.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I don't know.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Will you tape it?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Kramer... (points to Marla),10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Yeah. (He exits),10,S04E10,4
JERRY,So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Never came back.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,It's me.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,I didn't get it.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"Well, he wanted me to move in with him.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Snapple?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,No thanks.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Go on.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Well I wouldn't move in because...,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Yes.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Well because...,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Yeah.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters),10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,Hello!,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,I should be going.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"No, no, I'm leaving.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I like that thing in your hair there.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,No thanks.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,I should be going.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,So we'll talk about the hooks then?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Yes. (She exits),10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,What? Was it something I said?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"She's a virgin, she just told me.",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,Well I didn't know.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Well it's not like spotting a toupee.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"No, no, I mean...",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves),10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,It's George.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,She's a virgin?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,A virgin.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Wow. So what're you gonna do?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yeah, me too.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,I'm in. Let's go for it.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,What do you want?,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"I don't care, whatever.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Okay. What are you getting?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,What's a Chow Fung?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,It's a broad noodle.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"What do you mean, a broad noodle?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,It's a big flat noodle.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Well I don't want a big flat noodle.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,What kind of noodle do you want?,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Who says I want a noodle?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Fine.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Get extra MSG.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,So they just leave?,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,Eh.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Yeah.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Your butler?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What about me?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,There was a bit of an accident.,10,S04E10,4
PING,Head hurts. Head really hurts.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What happened?,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Something happened to the food?,10,S04E10,4
PING,I only saved one bag.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,I'll get some ice.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters),10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"Hey, you got the food?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yeah, here.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"What took you so long? Hey, Ping!",10,S04E10,4
PING,Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch),10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,Yeah. Where's yours?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,He dropped it.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"Oh, that's too bad.",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.",10,S04E10,4
PING,"No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.,10,S04E10,4
PING,"(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.",10,S04E10,4
PING,(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What do you mean? They know we're here.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"No, no, would you get up?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"I can do this, Jerry.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,No.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits),10,S04E10,4
WOMAN,"Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)",10,S04E10,4
MAN #1,"Hey, Jerry.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.",10,S04E10,4
RITA,"Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?",10,S04E10,4
RITA,"He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)",10,S04E10,4
RITA,"Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.",10,S04E10,4
MAN #2,Where's George?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.",10,S04E10,4
SUSAN,David Letterman's on the floor?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yeah, he just walked by.",10,S04E10,4
RITA,"Well, I think we should get started anyway.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Yeah, good idea.",10,S04E10,4
RITA,So how are you guys comin' along?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.",10,S04E10,4
RITA,Good. (Pause),10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",10,S04E10,4
RITA,So that's the idea?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.",10,S04E10,4
MAN #2,Those collars are funny!,10,S04E10,4
MAN #1,Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters),10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?",10,S04E10,4
RITA,I'm Rita Kearson.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Would you give him the TV back?,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan),10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!,10,S04E10,4
SUSAN,Hello?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?",10,S04E10,4
SUSAN,What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Fired? Why?,10,S04E10,4
SUSAN,"Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,But I had no... I didn't realize.,10,S04E10,4
SUSAN,"You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,I just feel terrible This is just terrible.,10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.",10,S04E10,4
SUSAN,I'll speak to you later.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Why did he fire her?,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!",10,S04E10,4
KRAMER,"What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,What?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,Another job?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Couple of interviews.,10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What? Leave? Where? Why?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,"You know, the apartment.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Why would I leave? This is my apartment.,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Well what if it was my apartment?,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?,10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.",10,S04E10,4
MARLA,Maybe I should get going.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What else did you say to her?,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.,10,S04E10,4
JERRY,I was trying to be.,10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?",10,S04E10,4
JERRY,"Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.",10,S04E10,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.",10,S04E10,4
GEORGE,"What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.",10,S04E10,4
WOMAN,"A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.",10,S04E10,4
CAROL,"A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)",10,S04E10,4
WOMAN,A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!,10,S04E10,4
[Setting,Monk's Coffee shop],11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,Mm-hm.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.",11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!",11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"Hey, Georgie.",11,S04E11,4
JERRY AND ELAINE,Hi.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(To George) What's the matter?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"""Caught"" you? Doing what?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Nods) Uh-huh.,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,(Laughing) She caught you?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,Where?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"""Glamour""?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"..So, one thing lead to another..",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"So, what did she do?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.",11,S04E11,4
KRMAER,(Reflecting on the story so far) Man..,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,What did you do?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,I zipped up!,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"No, I guess you couldn't have..",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,(Finishing it off) ..done that.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,(Between chuckles) How is she?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"It's not funny, Elaine.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's there!""",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"""Glamour""?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Definite) All together.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"Oh, gimme a break..",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"Oh, like you're gonna stop?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY AND ELAINE,C'mon..,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,You don't think I can?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,No chance.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Daring) You think you could?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,Care to make it interesting?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"Sure, how much?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,A hundred dollars.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Pointing) You're on.,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,You?,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,Yeah.,11,S04E11,4

GEORGE AND JERRY,"(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,Why?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,Because you're a woman!,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,So what?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,(Sarcastic) Oh.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.",11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,(Making a point) Not everyday.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Alright, look, you want to be in?",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,Yeah!,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"No, a thousand!",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Alright, you're in for one-fifty.",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.",11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table),11,S04E11,4
[Setting,Jerry's apartment],11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Defensively) Whatever.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,How is she?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,It's me.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door),11,S04E11,4

GEORGE,"Oh, the virgin?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,Yeah.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.",11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,Where?,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,(In awe) Wow!,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..",11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,I would imagine it's all naked.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,Hey.,11,S04E11,4
JERRY AND GEORGE,(Only turning back for a second) Hey.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Over his shoulder) Not me.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,What're you looking at?,11,S04E11,4
JERRY,There's a naked woman across the street.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.,11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,Have a good time.,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,(Declaring) I'm out!,11,S04E11,4

KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,You're out?!,11,S04E11,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?",11,S04E11,4
ELAINE,"Well, that was fast!",11,S04E11,4
JERRY,"Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)",11,S04E11,4

GEORGE,"(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.",11,S04E11,4
ESTELLE,"Don't give me ""Ma"". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.",11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"Ma, people can hear you.",11,S04E11,4
ESTELLE,(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!,11,S04E11,4
GEORGE,"(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!",11,S04E11,4
ESTELLE,I want you to go see a psychiatrist.,11,S04E11,4

DENISE,Oh.. thank you.,11,S04E11,4

But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, ""Where do you live?"" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building.

GEORGE,I confused it with another awning.,12,S04E12,4
KRAMER,So how we doin' on time?,12,S04E12,4
GEORGE,"We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!",12,S04E12,4

GEORGE,This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.,12,S04E12,4

JERRY,DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?,13,S04E13,4
ELAINE,"Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.",13,S04E13,4
KRAMER,Hey!,13,S04E13,4

ELAINE,No. I don't want him looking.,13,S04E13,4
JERRY,Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.,13,S04E13,4

GEORGE,Was there any nostril penetration?,13,S04E13,4
JERRY,There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.,13,S04E13,4
GEORGE,"So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?",13,S04E13,4
JERRY,Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?,13,S04E13,4
GEORGE,I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.,13,S04E13,4

SUSAN,I need someone a little more stable.,13,S04E13,4
GEORGE,"I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!",13,S04E13,4
SUSAN,People don't change.,13,S04E13,4
GEORGE,I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.,13,S04E13,4
SUSAN,I'm not a soft boiled egg.,13,S04E13,4
GEORGE,And I am not a piece of toast.,13,S04E13,4
SUSAN,I just don't think we have anything in common.,13,S04E13,4

Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.",13,S04E13,4

JERRY,Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,What?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,This is not good. This is not good.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,What's the matter?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Why not?,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Biff?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,What?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,You're not worried about that?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"No, of course not.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well, should we leave?",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"I don't have to be funny, I don't care.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,You don't?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,No way! It's completely under my control.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Of course I can, am I being funny now?",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,A little.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,Yeah.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"George, is this funny?",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,What? What did I do?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,Hi.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,"Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Well, nobody likes to get old, right?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Funny guy, huh?",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well thank you very much, it's about time.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,Hey.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, the camp ended a few days early.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Why?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Uh, well there was an incident.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,What happened?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,What?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,You punched who in the mouth?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,Mickey Mantle.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,What happened?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Wow! Joe Pepitone!,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,You plunked him.,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Wow, this is incredible!",15,S04E15,4
BABU,Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,What's going on out there?,15,S04E15,4
BABU,"What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"(to Kramer) Yeah, so?",15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, ""Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!""",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,So what'd you do?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, I got the hell out of there.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,They took Babu away?!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!",15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,What?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Well this is interesting.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,What is it?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.",15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, doesn't he need that?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Yeah, so am I being funny now?",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"No, actually, you're not being funny now.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Ah, will you stop it already?",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Jerry, please?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,How long is this gonna go on?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,Till I'm comfortable.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well, when is that gonna be?",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,After consummation.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.,15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.,15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,"You're a very serious person, aren't you?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,I understand.,15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,I think it's curdled.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,I don't care.,15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,Do you ever laugh?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,That's so sad. What do you do?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I'll just pay for this.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,Hi.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,"Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Babu!,15,S04E15,4
BABU,"Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,You remember Elaine.,15,S04E15,4
BABU,"Yes, yes of course!",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,Nice to meet you.,15,S04E15,4
BABU,So nice of you both to come.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Oh, Babu.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,"No no, you're both very kind, very kind.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,We try.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,We do what we can.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,We do what we can.,15,S04E15,4
BABU,The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,"Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Oh, I don't want to bother you.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,"No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,Come again?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,You had my Visa application?!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Well not technically.,15,S04E15,4
BABU,(extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Well what about her?,15,S04E15,4
BABU,I kill both of you!!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Babu?!,15,S04E15,4
BABU,No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!",15,S04E15,4
BABU,The wheels are in motion?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"The wheels are in motion, things are happening!",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,Jerry?,15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,I'm very attracted to him.,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,He never said anything funny.,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,He can't not be funny.,15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,"No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,I gotta go.,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Well, should I call you later?",15,S04E15,4
CHERYL,Please don't.,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,It's George.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,C'mon up.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Babu must be back.,15,S04E15,4
BABU'S BROTHER,"Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Where's Babu?,15,S04E15,4
BABU'S BROTHER,He is in Pakistan!,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,Who are you?,15,S04E15,4
BABU'S BROTHER,"I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.,15,S04E15,4
BABU'S BROTHER,Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,(offering a drink) Snapple?,15,S04E15,4
BABU'S BROTHER,"No, too fruity.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,She didn't help him?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,No.,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,Where is he?,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,He's in Pakistan.,15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,Oh boy.,15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"What do you mean, oh boy?",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE,"What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,That's because she had my mail.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.",15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,How could you go in there?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!",15,S04E15,4
JERRY,"Well, what happened?",15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"I got down in my knees and went, ""Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!""",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"So, what did he do?",15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,"Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.",15,S04E15,4
VOICE,Kramer?,15,S04E15,4
KRAMER,Yeah? It's my Chinese food.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,"Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.",15,S04E15,4
PING,Not anymore.,15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,What?,15,S04E15,4
PING,"Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.",15,S04E15,4
ELAINE,Why?,15,S04E15,4
PING,"She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.",15,S04E15,4
BABU,"So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here.",15,S04E15,4
BABU'S FRIEND,"This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?",15,S04E15,4
BABU,"I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.",15,S04E15,4
GEORGE (writing on a notepad),"Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, ""I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!""",16,S04E16,4
JERRY (copying it down and grinning),"That's funny, that's funny! ""I'm sick of cleaning."" That's very funny.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE (laughing),"I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Yeah, it's funny!",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"I mean, how funny is this?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY (low voice),It's funny.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Right,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,(Thinks) What does she say...?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE (thinking),"I don't know, what do women say?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,I don't know.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Alright, forget Elaine.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.),16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Hey.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Hey.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Hey.,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER (to Jerry),You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Who?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Did you talk to her?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,So what happened?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) ""Oh, hi! Kramer!"" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I know about the three dates.",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,You know what I did? I snubbed her.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"What do you mean, you snubbed her?",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY (smiling),Right by her?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Right by her!,16,S04E16,4
"JERRY (to George, hugs Kramer happily)","What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (throws the script at Jerry),I'm not even in here!,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I know.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"You couldn't ""keep track"" of everybody?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,You have no idea?,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.),16,S04E16,4
GAIL (to Jerry),I thought I'd find you here.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Well, Gail Cunningham.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Hi, Gail.",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Why?,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,He snubbed me.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Are you sure?,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,I thought you were finished.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"Well, tell him that I am mad at him.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,Pfeiffer's.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Ah, the power lunch crowd.",16,S04E16,4
GAIL (to Elaine),Nice shoes!,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Oh. Thank you.,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,Where'd you get 'em?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (modest),"They're um, Botticelli's.",16,S04E16,4
GAIL (impressed),"Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Really.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Would you care to join us?,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,See ya.,16,S04E16,4
"ELAINE (irritated, imitates Gail)","""Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.""",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,That bothered you?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,It did?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Yes! Couldn't you see that?,16,S04E16,4
JERRY (thinks),No. This is why you're not in the pilot.,16,S04E16,4
DANA,"Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, I feel like I've grown.",16,S04E16,4
DANA,"Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?",16,S04E16,4
DANA,"Yes, yes I did.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE (beaming),"Well, what'd you think?",16,S04E16,4
DANA (unenthusiastic),Uh...it was...good.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,You didn't like it?,16,S04E16,4
DANA,"Well, no, I -",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?,16,S04E16,4
DANA,It wasn't funny.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?",16,S04E16,4
DANA,"No, I didn't find it funny.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?,16,S04E16,4
DANA,"Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.",16,S04E16,4
DANA,"George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of ""com-med-dee""! You sitting here, telling people what to do.",16,S04E16,4
DANA,I think you'd better go.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!",16,S04E16,4
"GEORGE (immediately, to Elaine)","So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,I guess she didn't think it was funny.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,I thought your mother's paying for it.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, ""Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.""",16,S04E16,4
JERRY (to Elaine),"You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.),16,S04E16,4
KRAMER (to Jerry),"Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY (catches Elaine),"Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Well, you know, I...",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,You what?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, I kissed her.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,You kissed her?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Right on the mouth.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,And what did she do?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,She kissed me back.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER (realizing),"Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER (to Elaine),"Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,What? Who told you that?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Gail Cunningham.,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (angrily),"""How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!"" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,So what?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Hey! Gail!,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...!,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Why are you talking about my shoes?,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,What?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,What are you talking about?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.),16,S04E16,4
WAITER,Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"Look Elaine, I am very busy here.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,I am not discussing this. This is insane.,16,S04E16,4
WAITER,You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"Ya ya ya, here.",16,S04E16,4
WAITER,"Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,Thank you.,16,S04E16,4
WAITER,Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (opening the door),"Well, come in. (They shake hands.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY & GEORGE,Hi.,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Are you alright?,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Oh, Where did you eat?",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,Pfeiffer's.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Ah. I know the chef there.,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,Yeah. The food's usually terrific.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.),16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,What are you saying?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Oh, you have a daughter?",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,What?,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.),16,S04E16,4
JERRY,What?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Pasta primavera.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,No!,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Yeah.,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (coming out of the bathroom),"Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"So, you were saying how, um...about the script...",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,More jokes?,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Another ending?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.),16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Maybe we should go.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (from bathroom),Oh God. Oh my god.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)",16,S04E16,4
MOLLY,Hello.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Hi.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Hi.,16,S04E16,4
MOLLY,I'm Molly.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Oh, I'm Jerry.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,George.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,We're here discussing our script with your father.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.),16,S04E16,4
MOLLY,Daddy? Are you okay?,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (from bathroom),"Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"So, you live with your mother, huh?",16,S04E16,4
MOLLY,"Uh, yeah.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE (to Jerry),Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Uh huh.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)",16,S04E16,4
MOLLY,"Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,It's just a stomach thing.,16,S04E16,4
MOLLY,Yuck.,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (to Jerry and George),"We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (angrily),"Get a good look, Costanza?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,What were you doing?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,That's why I poked.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,What?,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,She did?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,"So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Pasta primavera?,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.),16,S04E16,4
KRAMER (to Jerry),"She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,She is?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi Stu.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE (lazily swinging the garbage bag around),From NBC?,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY (to Elaine),"If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,He poked me!,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,But she was fifteen.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Hey, now you're onto something.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,No.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"But...somebody like Gail, though.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Ya.,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Yah-hey.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Alright, I'll call her right now.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.),16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (to George),"What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,She said she'll do it.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Beautiful.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Beautiful.,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER (points at Elaine's feet),But she wants the shoes.,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,What?,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,She says she wants those shoes.,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"No, these were the last pair of these that they had!",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,I'll get you another one just like it!,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)",16,S04E16,4
"GEORGE (to Elaine, in a somber tone)","Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Never mind!,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?",16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,"Alright, what size are you?",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Seven-and-a-half.,16,S04E16,4
KRAMER,Eh! Bingo.,16,S04E16,4
GAIL (hands a plate to another chef),"Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Hey! Whattaya know!,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Look who's here!,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Fancy meeting you here!,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,Oh. Hello.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE (notices Russell's lunch),Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Didn't hear anything...,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.),16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (to Russell),"Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (not noticing Elaine's cleavage),"Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?",16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL (still not noticing Elaine's cleavage),No.,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (leaning forward),Do you have a...ketchup secret?,16,S04E16,4
RUSSELL,"No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE (flirtatiously),"Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)",16,S04E16,4
"RUSSELL (to Jerry and George, reconsidering about the pilot)","Field of vision, huh?",16,S04E16,4
GAIL,How's everything?,16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,Mmmm.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Really good.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,This pasta primavera is fabulous.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,Very tasty.,16,S04E16,4
GAIL,How'd everything go with that NBC guy?,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,Great.,16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.",16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Well, it's a funny idea.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,It's funny!,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"C'mon, funny is funny.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,If you can.,16,S04E16,4
GEORGE,"Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?",16,S04E16,4
ELAINE,"Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)",16,S04E16,4
JERRY,"I think what he's trying to say is, ""get the bouilla-base."" (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)",16,S04E16,4
ALLISON,I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!,17,S04E17,4
ALLISON,No... You're *something*.,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!,17,S04E17,4
ALLISON,You're good. You're *good*!,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,I'm bad. I'm *bad*!,17,S04E17,4
ALLISON,You're *killing* me!,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,Over you?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"I got two tickets to see ""Guys And Dolls"".",17,S04E17,4

JERRY,Unbelievable! She's not there.,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,What paper does she write for?,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.",17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...",17,S04E17,4

JERRY,Living or all time?,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,All time.,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.",17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,"Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,[indignantly] What's the matter with you?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"[quietly] C'mon, go along...",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me ""C'mon Jerry, go along, go along...""",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,Y'know I hear that all the time.,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,Hear what?,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.",17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,And you get along well with women.,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,I guess that leaves me in the clear...,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.",17,S04E17,4

GEORGE,"Yeah, how did you know that?",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,You told me that already like two months ago.,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Allison bought it for me.,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,How you gonna get out of *that* one?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?,17,S04E17,4
SHARON,"Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Jerry did you wash this pear?,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I washed it.",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,It looks like it hasn't been washed.,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,So *wash* *it*.,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,You hear the way he talks to me?,17,S04E17,4
SHARON,You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?,17,S04E17,4
SHARON,It's nice.,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Jerry said he didn't like it.,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"No, you said you didn't like it...",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?",17,S04E17,4
SHARON,So how did you two meet?,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Actually, we met in the gym locker room.",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.,17,S04E17,4
"(George takes a hold of Jerry's leg to stress the point and Sharon, who obviously thinks she has a real story here now, asks another question",),17,S04E17,4
SHARON,Do you guys live together?,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,[quizzically] Live together?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"No, I got my own place.",17,S04E17,4
"(Jerry is about *this* close (picture my thumb and forefinger *really* close together) to figuring out what is going on here, when the ""question fatale"" is asked",),17,S04E17,4
SHARON,And do your parents know?,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,Know *what*?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"No, of course not...",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,I mean that's fine if that's who you are...,17,S04E17,4

JERRY,Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Hey, where you going?",17,S04E17,4

GEORGE,"So, what did she say?",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,What are you talkin' about?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"I heard what you said ""Sharon, are you there?"".",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"Yes, I heard you!",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Well, maybe she was disconnected.",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!,17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...",17,S04E17,4
KRAMER,Yello?,17,S04E17,4

GEORGE,"""The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye""!",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?,17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!",17,S04E17,4
SHARON,Why don't you take a seat?,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,Thank-you.,17,S04E17,4
SHARON,Why don't you take your coat off?,17,S04E17,4
ELAINE,"So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.",17,S04E17,4
JERRY,"She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!",17,S04E17,4

GEORGE,"Two tickets to ""Guys And Dolls""! I'm gonna go with you!",17,S04E17,4

KRAMER,Not that there's anything wrong with that...,17,S04E17,4
"I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes when someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay community. They're probably discriminated against because of that, people say to them ""Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the shirt in and lost the wife"". But if people are even going to assume that people that are neat are gay, maybe instead of doin' this","""Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]"", they should vacuum ""Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<...""",17,S04E17,4
GEORGE,"Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...",18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Yeah, how about a mute?",18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,A mute would be good.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?",18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.,18,S04E18,4

GEORGE,"Volunteer work, huh?",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,What're you gonna do down there?,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,That's what I do with him [points at George],18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,When did you get this idea?,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?",18,S04E18,4

NEWMAN,You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!,18,S04E18,4

NEWMAN,I'm a United States postal worker.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,Sometimes...,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,Why *is* that?,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,"Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!",18,S04E18,4
RON,I'll give you five bucks.,18,S04E18,4

NEWMAN,Those records are worth more than five dollars!,18,S04E18,4

KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.",18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,They follow him like a cult.,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,He can't even walk down the street in South America...,18,S04E18,4
RON,"Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.",18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] I don't like it...,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,I don't like it.,18,S04E18,4
RON,"Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.",18,S04E18,4

JERRY,"The woman, she--",18,S04E18,4
SID,"Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' ""voo-doo"" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house...",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.",18,S04E18,4

SID,"I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.",18,S04E18,4
"(You can make out the albums pretty clearly. One is an apparent K-Tel ""classic""","""22 Explosive Hits"", I don't know the other one. Anyone? I believe ""The Beatles"" (The White Album) is there also.)",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,You don't want any of this?,18,S04E18,4
SID,"Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.,18,S04E18,4
SID,"Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...",18,S04E18,4
SID,With you? I'd rather be dead.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.",18,S04E18,4
SID,"Good. Thank God. Good riddance. [pause] Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!",18,S04E18,4
BEN,"No, I feel great for 85.",18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.",18,S04E18,4
BEN,I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...",18,S04E18,4
BEN,I'm grateful for every moment I have.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...",18,S04E18,4
BEN,I guess I just don't care.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"Wait a second, where are you going?",18,S04E18,4
BEN,Life's too short to waste on you.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, please--",18,S04E18,4
BEN,Get out of my way...,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...",18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,Mrs. Oliver?,18,S04E18,4

MRS. O,Does it bother you?,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...",18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there ""Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head"". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.",18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.",18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?",18,S04E18,4

ELAINE,I wish I could quit...,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,So quit!,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.",18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,"Well, here's your *albums* [Journey ""Escape"" is on top, BTW...]",18,S04E18,4

GEORGE,So you don't speak *any* English at all?,18,S04E18,4
HOUSEKEEPER,English? No.,18,S04E18,4
SID,"Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,Well you said they could come and take the records.,18,S04E18,4
SID,It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,You don't speak *any* English?,18,S04E18,4
HOUSEKEEPER,No English.,18,S04E18,4
GEORGE,I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--,18,S04E18,4
SID,"Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here.",18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,"Now calm down, Mr. Fields...",18,S04E18,4
SID,Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...,18,S04E18,4

MRS. O,And we would take long automobile trips--,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...",18,S04E18,4
MRS. O,Staring out the window--,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,Uh huh...,18,S04E18,4
MRS. O,You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"Well, that'll get you goin' right there...",18,S04E18,4
MRS. O,"Big, roaming cows--",18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,"Cows, well that's fascinating...",18,S04E18,4
MRS. O,That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.,18,S04E18,4
ELAINE,What?,18,S04E18,4
MRS. O,Mohandas.,18,S04E18,4

NEWMAN,"Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!",18,S04E18,4
RON,"Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing ""Mammy"". Heh heh heh...",18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,You are nothing but a piece of crap.,18,S04E18,4
RON,Pardon me?,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,A piece of crap.,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,I find you extremely ugly.,18,S04E18,4
RON,*Do* you?,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.,18,S04E18,4
RON,"Oh, is that right?",18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...,18,S04E18,4

KRAMER,[In Newman's ear] Make us.,18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,Make us!,18,S04E18,4
RON,"Oh, I'll make you!",18,S04E18,4
AGENCY REP,Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Yes, but--",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,[Into intercom] Yes?,18,S04E18,4
TIM,"It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Alright, c'mon up.",18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.",18,S04E18,4
AGENCY REP,Why were you taking him to the dentist?,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--",18,S04E18,4
AGENCY REP,What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Well, after he bit my friend--",18,S04E18,4
AGENCY REP,Bit your friend?!,18,S04E18,4
TIM,What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"I, I'm sorry.",18,S04E18,4
TIM,And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,"Well, I brought them up there to take his records--",18,S04E18,4
TIM,Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,Hey.,18,S04E18,4
JERRY,There you are. Did you find him?,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,"No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.",18,S04E18,4
NEWMAN,It was a real melee.,18,S04E18,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, a real brouhaha...",18,S04E18,4
SIDRA,"Oh, hi Jerry.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA (amused),Really.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA (stepping off),"Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,Thursday night.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Alright.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Good workout?,19,S04E19,4
"JERRY (mimics smoking an ""after sex cigarette"")",Tremendous workout.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,That's a pretty girl.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Tremendous girl.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,She's the one you went out with last night?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Yeah. I really like her.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"You know, uh...they're fake.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,What? Don't say that!,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Nah! They're fake!,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,How do you know?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Yes, they do!",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,No.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I don't want to see her naked.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Well, I do.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Well, that's your problem.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,What's his problem?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Wrong side?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,He can't go left.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Nah, we just play defense.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?,19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,I'll shout.,19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?",19,S04E19,4
BETSY,What? (The phone rings.),19,S04E19,4
GEORGE (attempting to make a move),"No, no, the machine'll get it...",19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"No, no, it's not on...",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,They'll call back.,19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"But George, what if it's an emergency?",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?",19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Alright, maybe four.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE's brain,"Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.",19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,You're sure?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,What? Just 'cause of that?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Well, I take it very seriously.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,Hey.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Well, I know what they feel like.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,You? How do you know?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE (laughs),I thought you hated Los Angeles.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Real busy now down at the office?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE (laughing),"Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,You put her on a pedestal.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,I put them on a dental chair.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,He puts 'em on a dental chair.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,That's funny. You're a funny guy.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Why, you think I should?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,I'm the consolation guy...?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,Consolation Guy is big.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,It's like ten dates in one shot.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Why don't you get a ""death in the family"" fare?",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,What?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,Really?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE's brain,"Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE's brain,"Ah, look who's here. ""Silicon Valley.""",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA (to her friend),"So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,"Oh, that's o.k.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Did he give you a reason?,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Really?,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,Yes! How did you know?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Oh, I know the type.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,So you can relate?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA (sits across from Elaine and takes her towel off),"You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls ""right into them."")",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,You fell on her?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I touched 'em.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,You what?,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I...touched...'em.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,You touched 'em?!,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Wow.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,Anyway...they're real.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Excuse me?!,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I think they might be real.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I've touched mine!,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,So have I.,19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE (to clerk),"You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.",19,S04E19,4
CLERK (to Kramer),"Oh, I'm very sorry.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...",19,S04E19,4
CLERK,You poor thing!,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER (breaking into tears),I...I...,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.",19,S04E19,4
CLERK,You're a good friend.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?,19,S04E19,4
CLERK,"Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,The death certificate?,19,S04E19,4
CLERK,"Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?,19,S04E19,4
CLERK,I know! But it happens.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?",19,S04E19,4
CLERK,That would be $387 round-trip.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER (in a perfectly normal tone of voice),"Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?",19,S04E19,4
CLERK,Yes.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,Hey!,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Hey. George off to Detroit?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.",19,S04E19,4
ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,Pffft - wrong.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,There's Sidra.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,There's Salman.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Where?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,Talkin' to that woman.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Talkin' to Sidra?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,I don't think that's Salman.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Well, I don't think they're real.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"If that's Rushdie, they're real.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"If they're real, that's Rushdie.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.",19,S04E19,4
"""SALMAN""",You've lived in the desert?,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?",19,S04E19,4
"""SALMAN""","Yes, I've been there.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,My name's Kramer.,19,S04E19,4
"""SALMAN"" (shakes Kramer's hand)","Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"So, uh...what kind of work do you do?",19,S04E19,4
"""SALMAN""",I'm a writer.,19,S04E19,4
BETSY (to Aunt May),Have you met my boyfriend George?,19,S04E19,4
AUNT MAY,No! (shakes George's hand.),19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George.",19,S04E19,4
AUNT MAY,"Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.",19,S04E19,4
AUNT MAY,"Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?",19,S04E19,4
BETSY,I'm not very hungry.,19,S04E19,4
AUNT MAY,They have some very nice snacks.,19,S04E19,4
FATHER JESSUP,I'm about to get myself a snack.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.",19,S04E19,4
FATHER JESSUP,This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE (loading up his plate with sandwiches),"Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)",19,S04E19,4
FATHER JESSUP,"You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,C'mon Jerry!,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, how can you be so sure?",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"What, did you ask her?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,I'm gonna find out tonight.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER (nods),"Oh, yes indeed...",19,S04E19,4
DR. ALLENWOOD,Why do you need a death certificate?,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.",19,S04E19,4
DR. ALLENWOOD,"Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Oh, that would be wonderful.",19,S04E19,4
DR. ALLENWOOD,"It was very nice meeting you, George.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,Likewise.,19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,What are you doing?,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,What?,19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,Did...did you just double-dip that chip?,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,Excuse me?,19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,You double-dipped the chip!,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"""Double-dipped""? What are you talking about?",19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,So...?,19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,"That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)",19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,"Oh, you don't, huh?",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.),19,S04E19,4
TIMMY,Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.),19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,"I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Hey, would you mind switching seats?",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,Why?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,O.K....(they switch places.),19,S04E19,4
JERRY,How ya doin'?,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,Good. How you doin'?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,I hear that's how she died.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,"Well, a lot of women are having them done.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Really?,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,Yeah.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,How do you like that.,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Aw, you know people.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,"It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,What do you tell them?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Whatever you want me to tell them.,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,"Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,No.,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,What if it's an emergency?,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Oh, there's no emergency...",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER (in hallway),"Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?,19,S04E19,4

JERRY,"I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.",19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.,19,S04E19,4
KRAMER,"Alright, c'mon!",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.),19,S04E19,4

SIDRA,Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.),19,S04E19,4

JERRY,"Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,I was just leaving.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"Right, you were leaving.",19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.,19,S04E19,4
JERRY,That was an accident!,19,S04E19,4
SIDRA,"I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)",19,S04E19,4
BETSY,"Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!",19,S04E19,4
DR. ALLENWOOD,Go back to New York! Get out!,19,S04E19,4
CLERK 2,"Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way.",19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)",19,S04E19,4
CLERK 2,What's this?,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,That's a picture of me next to the coffin.,19,S04E19,4
CLERK 2,Nice try.,19,S04E19,4
GEORGE,"Not even close, huh?",19,S04E19,4
JERRY,"You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Tonight.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,What's her name?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,I... don't... know...,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,How could you not know her name?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I did that too.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Sure.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Wow!,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Really? Who?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Nobody you know...,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Why don't you put it in the *bank*?,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Yes I did.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,Yes.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,What's with the gloves?,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Huh. What, the whole apartment?",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Wood is good.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,Definitely.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,Yep.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"What, you rented ""Home Alone""?",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Yeah.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,I thought you saw that already...,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"No, I saw ""Home Alone II"".",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Oh, right... But you *hated* it!",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,What for?,20,S04E20,4

JERRY,All right.. Go ahead.,20,S04E20,4

JERRY,"You said ""gloves""...",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Oooh, is that ""Home Alone""?",20,S04E20,4

ELAINE,"He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Yeah.,20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,What's wrong with him?,20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)",20,S04E20,4

DOCTOR,I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?",20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,"Are you asking because you saw ""20/20"" last night?",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,I sure am.,20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,But you *will* use... a retractor.,20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,We have to...,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)",20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!",20,S04E20,4

GEORGE,Oh. How's the guy?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)",20,S04E20,4

JERRY,"I know, I should've asked her.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,What're you gonna do now?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Aretha! (points finger at Jerry),20,S04E20,4
JERRY,No...,20,S04E20,4

JERRY,Where'd you get those?,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,The machine. You want one?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,No.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Here, take one.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,I don't want one.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"No, they're good! Take one..",20,S04E20,4

KRAMER,Just take one.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!",20,S04E20,4
"[As they struggle to force the Junior Mint on each other, Jerry pushes Kramers' hand away and -- in slow motion with the sound of a beating heart to emphasize the event -- The Junior Mint is launched into the air towards the operating table and, well, in a word","""Bingo"" -- with a small ""splat"" sound -- falls into Roy, the patient. The surgical team looks around puzzled as to what just happened -- but they continue on with the operation)",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?,20,S04E20,4

GEORGE,Into the hole?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Yes, the hole!",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Didn't they notice it?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,No!,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,How could they not notice it?!?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,W-ca-What did they do?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,They sealed him up with the mint inside.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Yes!,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Yeah.,20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,It's me.,20,S04E20,4

JERRY,Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Well, I didn't believe you.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,How could you not believe me?!?,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!",20,S04E20,4

KRAMER,It's very refreshing!,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...",20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,Prognosis... negative.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Prognosis *negative*!?,20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY and KRAMER,"Oh, my God...",20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk),20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom),20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...",20,S04E20,4

JERRY,"Oh, that's *fantastic*!",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"He didn't get better, did he?",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.",20,S04E20,4
ROY,"You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Y'know, art's a great investment.",20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,"Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.",20,S04E20,4
ROY,"Hey, George...",20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Yeah.,20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,"Awe, alright",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,That's nice.,20,S04E20,4
GEORGE,Thanks Roy.,20,S04E20,4
ROY,Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.),20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,"Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,What do you mean?,20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,"I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...",20,S04E20,4
KRAMER,Mint?,20,S04E20,4
DOCTOR,Those can be very refreshing.,20,S04E20,4
ROY,So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti),20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,I don't think so...,20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"We are... that means that we ah, we are...",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,I believe we're not...,20,S04E20,4
ELAINE,"(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Well, I'll think about it...",20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Really...,20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?",20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,Yeah.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Do you have it with you?,20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,"Yeah, it's in my purse.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)",20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,"Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)",20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,"Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...",20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,I had it autographed for my uncle.,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I-I know...",20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,"(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Yes I do.,20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,What is it?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,It-it rhymes with a female body part.,20,S04E20,4
WOMAN,What is it?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Mulva...,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Aub, ah, Gipple?",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Loleola?,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,Oh! Oh! *Delores*!,20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. ""Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.",20,S04E20,4
JERRY,"...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Is that bothering you?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"No, not at all...",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"Oh, could you please hurry?",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"[mockingly] ""Please hurry"". Look at you. Look at what you've become.",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"What? What have I become? I haven't ""become"" anything...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,I don't want to keep him waiting...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,He'll like you more...,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,That's impossible...,21,S04E21,4
WIFE,"Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?",21,S04E21,4
HUSBAND,Leave me alone.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"So, where am I dropping you?",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,His place...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"So, is tonight ""the night""?",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,You never know...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Boy, do you smell something?",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What is it?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,I think it's B.O.!,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,But the whole car smells.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,So?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"So when somebody has B.O., the ""O"" usually stays with the ""B"". Once the ""B"" leaves, the ""O"" goes with it.",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,I can't believe you ski!,21,S04E21,4
CARL,I'm a great skier.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Yeah? What else?,21,S04E21,4
CARL,"Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"[delightedly] Oh! You ""pillage and plunder""?",21,S04E21,4
CARL,...When I travel.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,This'll only take a second.,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm going to poke around...",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,George?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Renting a video! What do you got there?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, ... some stupid movie...",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,This is Mona.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, hi...",21,S04E21,4
MONA,Pleasure to meet you.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Yes. Well...,21,S04E21,4
MONA,"Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,You okay?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,I *know* who I'm talking to.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,I liked women?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,There you go.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"So, uh, how long has this been going on?",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Since you and I broke up.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Yeah.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"So, what have you got there?",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, I, uh--",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...",21,S04E21,4
CLERK,Next.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, that's me.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.",21,S04E21,4
CLERK,"Uh, what are you returning?",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.",21,S04E21,4
CLERK,"Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... ""A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk""...",21,S04E21,4
CLERK,"Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,$3.49? It says $1.49.,21,S04E21,4
CLERK,"Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,"George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What about skunk?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,I don't mind skunk.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Horse manure?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,I *loooove* horse manure.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Absolutely.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,It means he's lying.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Wow...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Why? Is that what he told you?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,No. Never.,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Anything's *possible*...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What's the matter with you?,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...",21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,"I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,I know the list...,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,What's that smell?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What smell?,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,Ooooh... You stink.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Whatd'ya mean I stink?,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,So?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!",21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,What happened?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,What is that? B.O.?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Yeah.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,This is *unbelievable* B.O.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"No, no. It's the valet guy.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Oh... No, that's ridiculous.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"The woman she's ""lesbianing"" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a ""Smell Gestapo"". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!",21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,"What do you mean-- ""stunk up""?",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Stinks.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Stinks!,21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,"Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!",21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,"Really? Well, I smell you now.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,That's from the car!,21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,"Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.",21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,I don't have time to smell cars.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,You've gotta smell the car,21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,I'm a busy man,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,C'mon! One whiff!,21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,"Alright, one whiff...",21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?",21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!,21,S04E21,4
RESTAURATEUR,"I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] ""...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk""...",21,S04E21,4
CARL,The valet had such bad B.O.?,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The ""O"" went from the valet's ""B"", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...",21,S04E21,4
CARL,That's a relief...,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,What?,21,S04E21,4
CARL,It's still there...,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.",21,S04E21,4
CLERK,That'll be $98.00.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,What $98.00?,21,S04E21,4
CLERK,That's what I said. $98.00.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"So, was it me?",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,You're an idiot.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,It's not me! It's the car!,21,S04E21,4
MONA,I didn't think I'd come.,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,I knew you would.,21,S04E21,4
MONA,"Oh, Kramer!",21,S04E21,4
CAR WASHER,"We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Let's do it.,21,S04E21,4
HAIRDRESSER,"The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Tomato Sauce?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!,21,S04E21,4
CARL,It still smells.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,It still smells!,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,How could it still smell after all that?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,I don't know!,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Well, what are you gonna do?",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,You're *selling* the car!?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Maybe I'll buy it.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,I still smell!,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Susan!,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Kramer!,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,What is going on?,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,"You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,He stole your girlfriend?,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Yes. She's in *love* with him.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...,21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--",21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,I'm Kramer.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,You think so?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,You're very sweet...,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Really?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Yeah, you're just so... hip.",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Oh, my God...",21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,What?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.,21,S04E21,4
ALLISON,George?,21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?",21,S04E21,4
ALLISON,"Good. You know, you owe me $50...",21,S04E21,4
GEORGE,"Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.",21,S04E21,4
ALLISON,Nice to meet you...,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Nice to meet you...,21,S04E21,4
ALLISON,That's a beautiful vest...,21,S04E21,4
SUSAN,Thank you...,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,"I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.",21,S04E21,4
SALESMAN,What year did you say this was?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,'90.,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,"Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,That's strange...,21,S04E21,4
SALESMAN,How many miles you got on this thing?,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,23 000.,21,S04E21,4
KRAMER,"And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...",21,S04E21,4
JERRY,Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!,21,S04E21,4
SALESMAN,I can't sell this car.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!,21,S04E21,4
HAIRDRESSER,"So, what do you want to do?",21,S04E21,4
ELAINE,Sauce me.,21,S04E21,4
JERRY,"I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,We don't walk that fast...,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,No seriously...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Seriously, we don't.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I gotta buy a present now?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Of course you do, it's an engagement party.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,You don't like the Drake?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Hate the Drake.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,I *love* the Drake.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,How could you not like the Drake?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Who's the Drake?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"""Who's the Drake""?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,The Drake is good!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"So listen, what are you gonna get him?",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom),22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,So what? That's easy.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Easy?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Uh, no, no, not yet.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Do you like the Drake?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,It's Isosceles,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,The chip-in!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Yeah!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"No, no! My car's not running.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,What about your father's car?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Are you serious?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Good thinking!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Good to meet you!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,So what are we gonna get him?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I like this area. I could live out here.,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?",22,S04E22,4
MAN IN CAR,No!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Why don't you take a handicap spot...,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,You think?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I don't want to walk that far.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,What if a handicapped person needs it?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Oh, come on, they don't drive!",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Yes, they do!",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Well there's spaces there, they must drive!",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the ""party""!",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,What does that mean?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, go ahead.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,George!,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Oh, come on, it's five minutes.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.,22,S04E22,4
"JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE",Don't worry. We won't forget!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Got to *love* the Drake!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Hey, what's going on over here?",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Must have been an accident...,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?",22,S04E22,4
WOMAN,"Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Is she OK?,22,S04E22,4
WOMAN,I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,(to George) Are you happy now?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Who would think these people we're gonna be here?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,I don't know...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,What about the party? What about the Drake?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Screw the Drake!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,I love the Drake!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Let's just take a bus back to the city.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Can't leave the car here!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Why not?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,It's my father's car!,22,S04E22,4
MAN,Let's smash it!,22,S04E22,4
EVERYBODY,Yeah! Yeah!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Let's get out of here.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,You'd think...,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Most of them don't even have batteries.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Yeah...,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Well, I'm sorry!",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Me?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Oh, they won't?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Not if they don't know you...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,No chance in hell!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming ""There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!"" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"That's good, we'll give it a try...",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,That's good...,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Huh?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...",22,S04E22,4
FRANK,Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!",22,S04E22,4
ESTELLE,(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,"(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!",22,S04E22,4
MAHJONG LADY,"Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!",22,S04E22,4
FRANK,No it isn't!,22,S04E22,4
MAHJONG LADY,"So what are you doing now, Georgie?",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,Where the hell is my paper?,22,S04E22,4
MAHJONG LADY,You're writing a pilot?,22,S04E22,4
ESTELLE,"With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...",22,S04E22,4
MAHJONG LADY,So what's it about?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge",22,S04E22,4
MAHJONG LADY,"This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!",22,S04E22,4
ESTELLE,"Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...",22,S04E22,4
ESTELLE,"He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Sure!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,The Drake is great!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Yes?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,It's me.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Come on up.,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,You went to see her?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Yeah.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Wow, what happened?",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,I'm in love.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,What?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Ah, I'm glad you're here.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,What?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,A wheelchair? What for?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Doesn't she have collision?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"George, I'm in love with her!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,No! She needs it now!,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Well...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Hey, we told you not to park there!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Can't we just fix the old one?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!",22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"So now, what's this got?",22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,"Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,How much?,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,6200,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Do you have something a little more... less expensive?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY and ELAINE,Hey Drake! Hi Drake!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?",22,S04E22,4
THE DRAKE,"Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,So where're we eatin'?,22,S04E22,4
THE DRAKE,"Well, actually... Jerry...",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,I'm *really* hungry!,22,S04E22,4
THE DRAKE,... we just broke up...,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,When did this happen?,22,S04E22,4
THE DRAKE,"About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Oh, cristal clear!",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,They know how to make 'em...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?,22,S04E22,4
THE DRAKE,(through his sobbing) Gagliano's... that's pretty good...,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Well... we should...,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Get movin'...,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...",22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,"Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,But this'll get you around?,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,"Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Like what?,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,"For example, your tremor-damping.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Now what's that?,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Well, is it alright if I try it?",22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,Hop in!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Oh yeah!,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,I tell ya...,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,"When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,How much?,22,S04E22,4
SALESMAN,How about $240?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE & KRAMER,We'll take it!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Drake gave her the TV?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,I know it is!,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,They don't know anybody in Chicago.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Hey.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,"Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.",22,S04E22,4

JERRY,We're not gettin' that TV.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,The Drakette took it.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.",22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Well, she has it!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Maybe we should call her.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Well, who's gonna call?",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,You are.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Because that's your thing!,22,S04E22,4

JERRY,Yeah.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I could see that...,22,S04E22,4
(Alison through phone),Hello?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...",22,S04E22,4
(Alison through phone),I gave all the gifts to charity.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,"Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...",22,S04E22,4
(Alison though phone),I hate the Drake.,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,Everybody does. Bye-bye....,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,She gave it to charity.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Charity?!? That's apalling.,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,You mean a blessing in disguise?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Yeah....,22,S04E22,4

FRANK,Under arrest? What for?,22,S04E22,4
COP,"Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.",22,S04E22,4
FRANK,What's that?,22,S04E22,4

FRANK,George! George!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Your father got arrested? For what?,22,S04E22,4

JERRY,Ho-ly!,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,So what are you gonna do?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,I agreed to become his butler.,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,What?,22,S04E22,4

JERRY,She dumped you?,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?,22,S04E22,4
JERRY & GEORGE,(hesitatingly) ... no...,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,...you're very attractive...,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!,22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Drop dead?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Boy, even I never heard that one...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,She's pretty rough!,22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,Yeesh-jip!,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,240 bucks?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Well, it was slightly used...",22,S04E22,4
JERRY,Used?,22,S04E22,4
Frank (picking up his shoes),I don't think you did such a good job on these...,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,What!?,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,"George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Sons of bitches!,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,"Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Big screen TV?,22,S04E22,4
FRANK,Do you think you can handle it?,22,S04E22,4
ALLISON,Yes?,22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,"Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.",22,S04E22,4
ALLISON,"Oh great, it's right over there.",22,S04E22,4
KRAMER,"Ooh, it's a big one!",22,S04E22,4
GEORGE,Who's got the receipt?,22,S04E22,4
ELAINE,I do.,22,S04E22,4

KRAMER,What are the chances of that?,22,S04E22,4
[setting,night club],23,S04E23,4
JERRY,"To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go ""Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch."" According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.",23,S04E23,4

JERRY,Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!,23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,Neither are you.,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?,23,S04E23,4

KRAMER,Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!,23,S04E23,4

KRAMER,What you didn't think I was really laughing?,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,It stinks.,23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,Let me see you do it.,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Say something funny.,23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Ah..........,23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,"Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)",23,S04E23,4

ELAINE,That was two months ago.,23,S04E23,4
RUSSELL,Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret),23,S04E23,4

RUSSELL,But I want you.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).",23,S04E23,4
RUSSELL,Is it something I said... or did?,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.",23,S04E23,4

GEORGE,What happened to the raisins?,23,S04E23,4
JAY,"Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!",23,S04E23,4
GEORGE,Did he just steal the raisins?,23,S04E23,4
STU,You think he stole them?,23,S04E23,4
CASTING DIRECTOR,(enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,(to Kramer) What are you doing here?,23,S04E23,4
CASTING DIRECTOR,You two know each other?,23,S04E23,4
STU,"Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.",23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,That's true.,23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,"(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?",23,S04E23,4
STU,"I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.",23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves),23,S04E23,4
"(We see Kramer, groaning and holding his stomach, running down the hall, and opening the bathroom's door. Someone in there says","""Sorry buddy, full house."" We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant ""Sorry, customers only"" ...running into a movie theater ""Hey you need a ticket!"" ...running through the park...)",23,S04E23,4

JERRY,"Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.",23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Really?,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Yes.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Who is it?,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,"She's an eskimo, actually.",23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,"She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.",23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"Listen, was Russell at the casting?",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,"No, he didn't show up.",23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,No. No you're not.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Why do I keep setting you up?,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,I don't know.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Beside that. Look at the waitresses.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts),23,S04E23,4
JERRY,What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Ah...,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"Yes, I would say.",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,What's going on here. How is that possible?,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,Do you think it's a coincidence?,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?,23,S04E23,4
WAITRESS,"He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)",23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,"You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.,23,S04E23,4

DOCTOR,I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm),23,S04E23,4

DOCTOR,A biopsy.,23,S04E23,4
GEORGE,A biopsy?,23,S04E23,4
DOCTOR,Yeah.,23,S04E23,4

GEORGE,He said he didn't know what it was.,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Alright. So?,23,S04E23,4
GEORGE,"When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a ""get outta here"". That's what I wanted to hear ""Cancer? Get outta here?""",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,"Well, maybe he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality.",23,S04E23,4
GEORGE,"How could you be a doctor and not say ""get outta here""? It should be part of the training at medical school ""Cancer? Get outta here!"" ""Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?"" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)",23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Can't you at least die with a little dignity?,23,S04E23,4
GEORGE,No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?,23,S04E23,4
JERRY,Hey. What happened to you yesterday?,23,S04E23,4

JERRY,Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?,23,S04E23,4
KRAMER,"It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...",23,S04E23,4

GEORGE,(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.,23,S04E23,4
ELAINE,So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.,23,S04E23,4

ELAINE,"Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)",23,S04E23,4

We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'.

ELAINE,"(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.",2,S05E02,5
GEORGE,"(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?",2,S05E02,5
JERRY,Yeah.,2,S05E02,5
GEORGE,"What, have you completely lost your mind?",2,S05E02,5
KRAMER,"(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..",2,S05E02,5
GEORGE,"Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!!

GEORGE,"(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?",2,S05E02,5
KRAMER,"Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.",2,S05E02,5
GEORGE,"My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) ""puffy shirt"".",2,S05E02,5
JERRY,"(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for ""Avast ye matey"" - what the hell does that mean?! ""20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!"" - there's no comeback for that!",2,S05E02,5
ELAINE,"(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.",2,S05E02,5
KRAMER,You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.,2,S05E02,5
JERRY,Really? What happened?,2,S05E02,5
KRAMER,(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.,2,S05E02,5
JERRY,What happened with all the shirts?,2,S05E02,5
KRAMER,They gave them all to Goodwill.,2,S05E02,5
HOMELESS MAN,"Ahh, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?",2,S05E02,5
JERRY,"(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..",2,S05E02,5
ELAINE,Do you ever spit on anybody from here?,3,S05E03,5

KRAMER,"Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,All right.,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Yeah.,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,I gotta get out of this city.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently),3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,You don't have an old pair?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,I broke 'em playing basketball.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs),3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,There's a lot of change down there.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, especially those frames.",3,S05E03,5

GEORGE,"Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,You just gotta mention my name.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,That's it?,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler),3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,What about these?,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Now those look good, they're very bold.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?",3,S05E03,5
DOG OWNER,It's okay with me.,3,S05E03,5

GEORGE,Can you believe that guy?,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"I'm okay, it's just a nip.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,My leg looks pretty bad.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.,3,S05E03,5

JERRY,Are you sure?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Yes, positive.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,I know! I was squinting.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!,3,S05E03,5

DWAYNE,What about him?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,You do know Kramer?,3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,Yes...,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Well, I'm mentioning his name.",3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,Why?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Because... you know...,3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,"No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,But he was squinting.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!",3,S05E03,5
DOCTER,Okay.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?,3,S05E03,5
DOCTER,"Not shot, dog bite.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?",3,S05E03,5
DOCTER,"Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Nah, look at this. Cable's out.",3,S05E03,5
AMY,"Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?",3,S05E03,5
AMY,Yesterday?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.",3,S05E03,5
AMY,I didn't do anything.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,(laughing) Oh you must have done something.,3,S05E03,5
AMY,"No, nothing really.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?,3,S05E03,5
AMY,"Well, I did go out for a little while.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.",3,S05E03,5
AMY,You can't thrust anyone.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?",3,S05E03,5
AMY,What are you talking about?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Look, my friend saw you.",3,S05E03,5
AMY,Saw me? With who?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,You tell me.,3,S05E03,5
AMY,There's nothing to tell.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,There isn't?,3,S05E03,5
AMY,No.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?,3,S05E03,5
AMY,I had a feeling this was to good to be true.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Why?,3,S05E03,5
AMY,I knew there had to be another side to you.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"No, no, there's no side!",3,S05E03,5
AMY,"There is a side, an ugly side.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"No, no, no ugly side.",3,S05E03,5
AMY,"Look, I think I'm gonna go.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Why?,3,S05E03,5
AMY,It's really hot in here.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?",3,S05E03,5
AMY,Yeah. When you getting an air conditioner?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,I was an idiot for listening to you!,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Hey, I saw what I saw.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,What side?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"A bad side, an ugly side.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Ooh, so what?",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Ah, he'd just deny it.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,There must be some way to find out.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Amy said nothing happened.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Heh, Mercury head. You mind?",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,A little white dog?,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,Yeah.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,I'm afraid of dogs now.,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,He's like a squirrel.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,Well he frightened me.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Did you get the shot?,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,No. He said I didn't need a shot.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"What, you think I should have?",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,The AC is on it's way.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,What?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"That's right, no discount!",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,Well did you mention my name?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Yes, I mentioned your name.",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,And?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Pbbbs, Bubkis!",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"You know, George, that's an onion.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Yes it is.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"I saw them making out, you can believe it.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.",3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Right this way, mister Doody!",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Hey, Dwayny.",3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,Oh hello Kramer.,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,What is going on here?,3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,What are you talking about?,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,"Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.",3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,Who said anything about a discount.,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.",3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,For what?,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,Remember this?,3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,What are you doing?,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?,3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,Put that away!,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!",3,S05E03,5
DWAYNE,"All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.",3,S05E03,5

JERRY,(To George) Who picked these out?,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,I did!,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.,3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Well Elaine was supposed to help me.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Hey, hey.",3,S05E03,5

JERRY,"Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.",3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,Madam? What are you calling me madam for?,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,They're ladies' glasses.,3,S05E03,5
KRAMER,"Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.",3,S05E03,5
GEORGE,He sold me ladies' glasses!,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.,3,S05E03,5

JERRY,He does look like a horse.,3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!",3,S05E03,5
DOG OWNER,Hey who are you calling stupid?,3,S05E03,5
JERRY,"Hey, shall we spit on him?",3,S05E03,5
ELAINE,"No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.",3,S05E03,5

ELAINE,"No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,"Then, what was all that sniffing?",4,S05E04,5

GEORGE,"I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?",4,S05E04,5
FRANK,"Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.",4,S05E04,5
ESTELLE,I am not giving him a bra.,4,S05E04,5
FRANK,Why not?,4,S05E04,5
ESTELLE,Because I don't need him looking at my bra.,4,S05E04,5
FRANK,"Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!",4,S05E04,5
GEORGE,Do we have to...?,4,S05E04,5

ESTELLE,I'm not betting!,4,S05E04,5
FRANK,Take a look.,4,S05E04,5
ESTELLE,"All right, I'll get a bra.",4,S05E04,5
FRANK,(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!,4,S05E04,5
GEORGE,She doesn't want to get a bra.,4,S05E04,5
FRANK,"I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.",4,S05E04,5
GEORGE,"All right, it wouldn't kill me.",4,S05E04,5
FRANK,"How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.",4,S05E04,5

KRAMER,"And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,"Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.",4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,"Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,"No, he didn't use 'man'.",4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,"I mean when he was leaving did he say ""I'm splittin'""?",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,"No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.",4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,Whoh!,4,S05E04,5
JERRY,Do you think that's a bad sign?,4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,"Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?,4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"Hello.... hello, oh...",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"Well, you notice anything?",4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,Ooh...,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,Did anyone call?,4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"You got a few messages, I wrote them down.",4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,Where are they?,4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.",4,S05E04,5

JAKE,What?,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,Nah it's nothing.,4,S05E04,5
JAKE,What is it?,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,It's nothing.,4,S05E04,5
JAKE,Tell me.,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,What are you talking about?,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", but you didn't use an exclamation point.",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,So?,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,What's so curious about it?,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.",4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.,4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.",4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.,4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.",4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!",4,S05E04,5
JAKE,"Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,You're out of your mind you know that.,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,Why?,4,S05E04,5
JERRY,It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"Well, I felt a call for one.",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,"A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.",4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.,4,S05E04,5
JERRY,George was right. Didn't take you long.,4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,Anything new with that guy on drugs?,4,S05E04,5
ELAINE,"Oh, he's not on drugs.",4,S05E04,5

ELAINE,"What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.",4,S05E04,5
KRAMER,"All right, What about the money?",4,S05E04,5
JERRY,"What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!",4,S05E04,5

JERRY,(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.,5,S05E05,5

ELAINE,"Huuh, Wow.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,Me? Godfather?,5,S05E05,5
STAN,Yes.,5,S05E05,5

GEORGE,"Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,A pig-man?,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"A pig-man. Half pig, half man!",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.",5,S05E05,5

ELAINE,"Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Well, maybe we should.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,I don't know.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,Maybe they're admiring your spot.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,They're all looking up.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Hey, there's a guy up the roof.",5,S05E05,5

JERRY,A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,You mean that wasn't uh.,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Yeah.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,No.. you?,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Ya.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,What'd you think?,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,Hey.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Ah, you're screwed.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Well I have to interview a Mohel.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,YEA!,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,What's the matter?,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Are you alright?,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,What now?,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,Look look.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) ""Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research"".."" Government funds genetic research at area hospital"" ... Yeah, so?",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"pig-man, baby. pig-man.",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,If I hear about this pig-man one more time...,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, ""Hey he's no pig-man!""",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. ""Oo that little tail really turns me on.""",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,(MUMBLES) That's just about enough,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,Yeah. So how does that help me?,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, my roommate in college.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,So what'd you think?,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,(thinks for a second) I got used to it.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished ""oink"" of pig-man cries out for help.",5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Well, if I hear an anguished ""oink"", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,What?!,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Oh, it's George.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,The pig-man can take the bus.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,Be realistic George.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.",5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,Yea.,5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,"Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors, patients, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Well, I join them in their grief.",5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,"Horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they thought he was flying. You know how children are, ""Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying"" And then, splat...",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?",5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,Mrs. Sweedler's fine.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.",5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,How is that?,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.",5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.",5,S05E05,5
Mrs. SWEEDLER,"(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.",5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,Mr.Constanza.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,Yes.,5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,Yes.,5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,"... and you greedily, callously want to profit from it?",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..",5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,"Get out! Get out, now! Get out of my office.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,Should I leave this..?,5,S05E05,5
MRS. SWEEDLER,GET OUT!,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?",5,S05E05,5
RESIDENT,I don't know what you're talking about.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).,5,S05E05,5
RESIDENT,No.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?,5,S05E05,5

JERRY,He's late already.,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.,5,S05E05,5

WOMAN,I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,Oh.,5,S05E05,5
KRAMER,"We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.",5,S05E05,5
STAN,(Seeing Myra run away sobbing) Myra?,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"Kramer, what's the matter with you?",5,S05E05,5

I almost had a heart attack! (THE CROWD GROWS UNEASY) (CALMING DOWN) Ok, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway, we're here to perform the mitzvah of the bris... (The Baby starts crying) (WITH INCREASING TENSION) ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries, with the loud, sustained, squealing cry, 'cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child 'cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched, squealing tone that can drive you insane!!!",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Did you find the place alright?,5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,"Did I find it alright? Could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading walking back to the subway, someone shouldn't crack me over the head and steal my bag, Because I'll be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum, like a dog, like a mutt, like a mongrel, like an animal! God forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. Oh no, that's too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! What's the point.",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,"(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha.",5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,"(TO ELAINE INTERRUPTING) Darling, you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass, why you chose the absolute edge, so half the glass is hanging off the table, you breath and that glass falls over, then you're gonna have broken glass on the carpet, embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the shag, broken glass, bits of broken glass that you never get out. you can't get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass, you can't get all the pieces, and then you think you got it all and two years later, you're walkin' barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself, is that what you want? I don't think you want that, is it? .. Do ya? Huh?",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...,5,S05E05,5

KRAMER,"No, I'm not going to let this happen.",5,S05E05,5
ALL,(numerous voices) Kramer! Let go of the baby! Kramer!,5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,"People compose yourselves. (Shouting as the struggle ends) This is a bris. We are performing a bris here, not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An sacred, ancient ceremony, symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something. (The Mohel opens his bag to start the process but drops it and his instruments fall out. People attempt to help him out) No! Don't touch it! Don't touch a thing!",5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Ok.,5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,"(muttering to Jerry).. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The money's good. There's a union, with benefits. And, cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow, you move on with your life... Anyway.",5,S05E05,5

JERRY,Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.,5,S05E05,5
ELAINE,Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!,5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.",5,S05E05,5

JERRY,Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.,5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,(REJERRY) The circumcision was perfect. The finger was your fault! You flinched!,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?",5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,(HE MAKES A SUDDEN MOVEMENT) Ya See! He flinched again!,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!",5,S05E05,5
MOHEL,One more peep out of you and I'll slice you up like a smoked sturgeon.,5,S05E05,5

ELAINE,You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.",5,S05E05,5
GEORGE,"(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the ""pig-man""?",5,S05E05,5

*Note,During this closing monologue; Jerry's finger is bandaged the same way it was during this episode.,5,S05E05,5
JERRY,"Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh.""",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Are these seats unbelievable or what?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Where's the sunblock?,6,S05E06,5

GEORGE,Gwen really wants to go.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,You're bringing a date to a party?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,No good?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,That woman is absolutely stunning.,6,S05E06,5

COWORKER,"You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?",6,S05E06,5
COWORKER,Take a car service. We have an account.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.",6,S05E06,5
COWORKER,"Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down.",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"Yea, I guess that could work.",6,S05E06,5

ELAINE,Yeah.,6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,"Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, not me. You know what I do?",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...",6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,(Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles?,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.,6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,Going deaf?,6,S05E06,5

GEORGE,Boy you are really smitten.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I gotta talk to her. What do you think?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I can't.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,What are you going to say?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"I don't know, ""Hi"".",6,S05E06,5

DRIVER,Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole thing up.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"No no, no no.",6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,"Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?",6,S05E06,5

ELAINE,What is this about?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Wow good plan.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY & KRAMER,No.,6,S05E06,5

JERRY,That's nice.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.",6,S05E06,5

ELAINE,"Oh great, thanks Kramer.",6,S05E06,5

JERRY,"Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Well there ought to be ball men.,6,S05E06,5

GWEN,"It's not you, it's me.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.",6,S05E06,5
GWEN,"All right, George, it's you.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,You're *damn* right it's me.,6,S05E06,5

GEORGE,I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.,6,S05E06,5
GWEN,I'm sure you do it very well.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,But I thought things were going great.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Yeah so did I.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Did she say why?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" routine.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,But that's your routine.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Yeah. Well aparently word's out.,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,"Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Really? At the tennis match?,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,"Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Cracks? What were they saying?,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.",6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,She must have seen me eating it on TV.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Why not. I would be.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.",6,S05E06,5

GEORGE,"One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Can we move on?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Yes I do.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.",6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?",6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Excellent question.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,I beg to differ.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Really.,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.",6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,Well we can take the car service from my office.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Really?,6,S05E06,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, they don't know.",6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you later.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Okay.,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you going to do tonight?",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Oh. (he stands there),6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.",6,S05E06,5
LAURA,They never have napkins there.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?,6,S05E06,5
LAURA,(does the same thing Jerry is doing) Yea.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.",6,S05E06,5
LAURA,"Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,They're breaking up? How do you know?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,She reads lips.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,What are they saying now?,6,S05E06,5
LAURA,"""It's not you, it's me.""",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Uh Laura, George was wondering if...",6,S05E06,5
LAURA,Sure. I'll do it.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,So I really had a good time.,6,S05E06,5
LAURA,"Yeah, me too.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,So you want to go to the party on Friday night?,6,S05E06,5
LAURA,Yeah.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?",6,S05E06,5
MAN,"Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.",6,S05E06,5
BOY,"(to Kramer) Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight years?",6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,"I may be old, but I'm spry.",6,S05E06,5
BOY,The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it?,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Oh I'll be up for it punk.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Yeah.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and ""eh"".",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Eh.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,It seems like a problem.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,You're kidding.,6,S05E06,5
KRAMER,Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Oh, when is that car service coming?",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I know. It's like X-ray vision.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.",6,S05E06,5
NEWMAN,"Hey, hey, hey. (to Jerry) I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Can't do it Newman.,6,S05E06,5
NEWMAN,"But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me two hours.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,It's not going to happen.,6,S05E06,5
NEWMAN,"(Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail, you control... information.",6,S05E06,5
JERRY,Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.,6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,(The same driver as before) Pardon me sir?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,I said pull over by the stop sign.,6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,"I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. Metalla-something.",6,S05E06,5

DRIVER,My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.,6,S05E06,5
DRIVER,Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,"I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.",6,S05E06,5

TODD,Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,Really?,6,S05E06,5
TODD,"Look George, I'm friends with both of you. But I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.",6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.",6,S05E06,5
TODD,You are so centered.,6,S05E06,5
GEORGE,"Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?",6,S05E06,5

ELAINE,She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?,6,S05E06,5
JERRY,No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.,6,S05E06,5
GWEN,I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.,6,S05E06,5

KRAMER,NNNN-Giddy-up!,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance?,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,No.,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,I like tap dancing.,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. It's all in those shoes.,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,"Are you kidding? They practice for years, those people.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,What's for supper?,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,Somebody's at the door.,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier.,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,(answers the door) Lloyd?,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Hello, Mrs. Costanza.",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,"Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.",7,S05E07,5
FRANK,Hey! Lloyd!,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,What are you doing here?,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Well, I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought I'd drop by and say, ""Hello"".",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,Georgie. Come here and say hello.,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,"How are you doing, Lloyd? I hear you're a big advisor for Dinkins now.",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"That's right. Hey, George.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,I uh ran into George yesterday in the city.,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,Ow! (hits George on the forehead) What's the matter with you?,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"So, uh, how's the arm, huh?",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Oh, it's good.",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,What's the matter with your arm?,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Nothing.,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Oh, his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion)",7,S05E07,5
FRANK,Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion),7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Yeah.,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,(continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this.,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,"Me, either.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Well, it comes and goes.",7,S05E07,5
FRANK,It's like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm.,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists, and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctor's card) So, I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him?,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,You mentioned George's name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York?,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.",7,S05E07,5
FRANK,"(grabbing the card) Hey, Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him?",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,All right. All right! I'll go.,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Well, that's great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And, uh, I'll be very interested to hear the diagnosis.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,And they said they can do it?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Hm-hmm.,7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,"Well, I hope you're satisfied.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,What?,7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,"Every word out of my son's mouth now is *beep*(fuck), *beep*(fuck), *beep*(fuck). (Jerry half turns and puts his head done for a second) You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Where's my *beep*(fuck)ing cupcake?",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Gee, I'm really sorry.",7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,He wants to be like you because you're a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him?,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,I'd be happy to.,7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,Thank you.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?",7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,No *beep*(fuck)ing way!,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Well, it was very nice seeing you again.",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,"Oh, it was good seeing you.",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Oh, um, by the way, who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day?",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,You must mean Elaine. Isn't she adorable?,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,She is. She is. How about giving me her number?,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.",7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes.,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Oh, great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot!",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Yeah!,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,Buh bye.,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,"Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh, that Lloyd Braun. He is something, isn't he?",7,S05E07,5
NEWMAN,"Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, ""Nice try, granny!"" And I sent her to the back of the line!",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Hello, Newman.",7,S05E07,5
NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Say, this yogurt is really something, huh? And it's non-fat! I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!",7,S05E07,5
OWNER,"Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities around my son, huh?",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?",7,S05E07,5
OWNER,That's right.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.",7,S05E07,5
OWNER,"Yeah, well, there is no fat.",7,S05E07,5
NEWMAN,"Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,How's it doing?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Not so good.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,So what.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,It changes the molecules.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.",7,S05E07,5
LAB TECHNICIAN,"Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Uh, does it matter if it's melted?",7,S05E07,5
LAB TECHNICIAN,"No! (Jerry looks at Kramer) You know, this is going to take a couple of days.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,That's okay.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Hello, there.",7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,Hello!,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,What do you got there?,7,S05E07,5
LAB TECHNICIAN,"Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a cholesterol work up on it.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Oh.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Okay, I'm done.",7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,It was really nice meeting you.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Well, the pleasure's all mine.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,You can't take that chemist out.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,Why not?,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Well, I think the whole thing stinks.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,That's enough.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,What?,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,With the smelling.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Uh-huh.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Hey!,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Hey,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Hey.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"So, guess who called me.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,We're going out tomorrow night.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,I can't say that.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Why not?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"So, you're taking his side?",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Already you're marrying this guy?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,You never know.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"No, I believe he can.",7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,Hi!,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Hi!,7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,You know Jerry.,7,S05E07,5
MATTHEW,"Of course, he's the funny *beep*(fuck).",7,S05E07,5
MARYEDITH,See!,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.",7,S05E07,5
MATTHEW,You did it.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,He tells him which soap to use.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!,7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,Where's the lights. Whoa!,7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,How about this?,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.,7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,Oo.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,Yaow.,7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,Ha hea.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.,7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,It's delicious.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,I hear you.,7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,Non-fat?,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?",7,S05E07,5
CHERYL,No.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Well, this is in case there's a tie!",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Name tags, hmm?",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,Maybe I'll mention that to him.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Really? Wow.,7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,You sure you don't want any yogurt?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"No, I'm watching my weight.",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Well, it's non-fat.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, so they say.",7,S05E07,5
LLOYD,"Well I'm done, should we go?",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Yeah. Okay.,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,(surprised) He said that?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, ""Boy, you're a lot of woman!""",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"No, but I expect to hear anytime.",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Why do you say that?,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,No. What about him?,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,You didn't hear?,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,Un-huh.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,Name tags?,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Yeah! So people can go around saying ""hello"" to one another.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Oh, I see. So you can go, ""Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!""",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,Yeow!,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.",7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,"Uh huh. Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Please, doctor.",7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,I've examined you.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Yes.,7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,I've looked at your X-rays.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Uh-huh.,7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Hmm. Really? Nothing?,7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,"Nothing, that would indicate involuntary spasms.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?",7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,"No, not really.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,How so?,7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?",7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,I don't know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.,7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,"Now, see here, doctor.",7,S05E07,5
DOCTOR,"I said, good-bye.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Huh, Okay.",7,S05E07,5
NEWS,"Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received some startling news today, when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement.",7,S05E07,5
GIULIANI,"It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.,7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.,7,S05E07,5
FRANK,"I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. ""Hello, Sam."" ""How are you doing, Joe?"" (George's arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .,7,S05E07,5
ESTELLE,Be quiet. They're starting the press conference.,7,S05E07,5
GIULIANI,"My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you, my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.",7,S05E07,5
GEORGE,Phew!,7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Oh, it stinks.",7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Mine, too. I got one more day.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,I can't eat this.,7,S05E07,5
NEWMAN,"(from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"It had fat in it, it's not good for you.",7,S05E07,5
NEWMAN,"I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get even with you for this. You can count on it.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,"Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.",7,S05E07,5
ELAINE,I wonder what actually happened in that lab.,7,S05E07,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, me, too.",7,S05E07,5
NEWMAN,I can't eat this.,7,S05E07,5
MATTHEW,"(hits Jerry to get his attention) Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*(fuck).",7,S05E07,5
JERRY,"The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go ""how do you like crotch?"" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.",8,S05E08,5
MR. TUTTLE,Well George we here at Sanalac like to think of ourselves as a fairly progressive company. We have a small but prestigious group of clients.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.,8,S05E08,5
MR. TUTTLE,"That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like I, like I don't have to explain every little thing to you. You understand everything immediately.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,I enjoy understanding.,8,S05E08,5
MR. TUTTLE,I want you to have this job. Of course...,8,S05E08,5
SECRETARY,Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.,8,S05E08,5
MR. TUTTLE,"Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really glad that you came in.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,I want you to have this job. Of course...,8,S05E08,5
JERRY & ELAINE,Yeah?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,That's it.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,What do you mean that's it?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"""Of course"" was the last thing he said?",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check with my associates.""",8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,"""I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time.""",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite.""",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,All right.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,Why don't you go ahead and call him?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,And if I don't call...,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Rest stop supply.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE & JERRY,Oh.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,Good for you.,8,S05E08,5

KRAMER,Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,What butcher?,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,You never get good haircuts.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Really?,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,"Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.",8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,What bachelor auction?,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,Polio?,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Okay.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,What are you all dressed up for?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,I had a job interview.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,Yeah. How'd it go?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Good. Of course...,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,Oh Jerry.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Oh hi Enzo.,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,"Oh, you've come for the haircut.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"No, actually I was just gonna...",8,S05E08,5
ENZO,"It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're my favorite customer. You've been with me for so long. You're so loyal.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)",8,S05E08,5
ENZO,"(He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference. It takes 10 minutes. Jerry, today I'm going to do something special for you.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Well I don't want to take too much off.,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,"Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair.",8,S05E08,5
MAN,"Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,He massacred you.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,I know.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,You look like you're five years old.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"Well, you gotta do it.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.",8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,So what?,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,I didn't want to hurt his feelings.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Yea but...,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.",8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,"I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,I don't want you to call him.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,"All right, geez. You're crazy.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,So I still haven't heard about that job.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,I have an idea.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Yeah?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,I show up.,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,What do you mean you show up?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Hmm. Not bad.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,What's the worst thing that could happen?,8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, so?",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,"Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.",8,S05E08,5

SECRETARY,He wants to know where his office is.,8,S05E08,5
MIKE,"Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.,8,S05E08,5
MIKE,Really?,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.",8,S05E08,5
MIKE,"All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.",8,S05E08,5

(Camera shot at the clock on his wall. The clock says 9,00.),8,S05E08,5
"(A moment later, the clock flips to 5",00.),8,S05E08,5

KRAMER,It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.,8,S05E08,5

ENZO,You do haircut in the apartment?,8,S05E08,5
GINO,No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,It looks very familiar.,8,S05E08,5

ELAINE,"Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.",8,S05E08,5
JERRY,Take the K-man.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,You can still go.,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,You think?,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,Do I think? He's repugnant.,8,S05E08,5
ELAINE,What would you wear?,8,S05E08,5
KRAMER,Whatever it takes.,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,"See, now Newman is a good customer.",8,S05E08,5
NEWMAN,Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to barber school. I always felt I had a talent for it.,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,"Oh, not everybody like Newman, so loyal.",8,S05E08,5
NEWMAN,"Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.",8,S05E08,5

ENZO,How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.,8,S05E08,5
NEWMAN,What's the catch?,8,S05E08,5
ENZO,You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.,8,S05E08,5
NEWMAN,"Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a year's free haircuts. And a comb.",8,S05E08,5
SECRETARY,"(over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here to see you.",8,S05E08,5

TUTTLE,"George, I'm surprised to see you here.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,You are?,8,S05E08,5
TUTTLE,I thought you would have taken the large office.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Oh. Really.,8,S05E08,5
TUTTLE,I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's that Pensky file? Let's see what you've been up to all week.,8,S05E08,5

GEORGE,You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.,8,S05E08,5
TUTTLE,(scoffs) You're not Pensky material.,8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,"(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.",8,S05E08,5
PENSKY,"Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was, now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted, myself included, and we're prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously, we would have no use for you.",8,S05E08,5
GEORGE,Obviously.,8,S05E08,5
PENSKY,Yes.,8,S05E08,5
SECRETARY,"(over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.",8,S05E08,5

NEWMAN,(on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.,8,S05E08,5
[Setting,Night club],9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? ""Oh, he was kind of quiet."" I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes ""You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore"".",9,S05E09,5
[setting,Elaine's office and Jerry's apartment],9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No eight years isn't such a long streak.,9,S05E09,5

JERRY,No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Get out!,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Not since June 29, 1980.",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,You remember the date?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George ""Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again.""",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)",9,S05E09,5

MICHAEL,Guess you better keep on his good side.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Very funny. That's very funny.,9,S05E09,5
JOANNE,I wouldn't sleep with my back to him if I were you.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.,9,S05E09,5
MICHAEL,Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car...,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!",9,S05E09,5
[setting,Jerry's],9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,But you like your Joel Rifkin.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Ask him to change it.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,You can't ask a person to change their name.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Why not?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Would you change yours?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah. Eighteen strangles.,9,S05E09,5
KRAMER,You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels),9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.,9,S05E09,5
KRAMER,I'll go.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.,9,S05E09,5
KRAMER,Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again),9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,You think I should have asked George?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Karen?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Oh! The Risotto broad.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,I tought you didn't like double dates.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,And you're taking...,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Jody the masseuse.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Hey, did you get a massage yet?",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,So what?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.",9,S05E09,5
[setting,The Chinese restaurant (the same as in 'The Chinese Restaurant')],9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her ""Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?""",9,S05E09,5
KAREN,That is so funny.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,(to Jody) You're listening to this?,9,S05E09,5
JODI,Yeah. I heard you.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,(to George) So what did she say?,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing),9,S05E09,5
JODI,You just said that you said it.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.",9,S05E09,5
KAREN,I'm learning a lot about you tonight George. I've never seen you like this.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying she's not attractive?,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.",9,S05E09,5
JODI,(to Jerry) Can we go?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah. Let's go.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,So soon? (they get up),9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,Yeah.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,Nice meeting you Karen.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,Yeah. Nice to meet you too and I'm gonna call you about that massage.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,Oh yeah.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him),9,S05E09,5
JODI,Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away),9,S05E09,5
[setting,Jerry's place later that night],9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I strained my neck last night.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,"Really, how?",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,So what's the deal with your friend George?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No deal. Why?,9,S05E09,5
JODI,"What was all that ""attractive women not getting tickets"" nonsense?",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.",9,S05E09,5
JODI,I don't know how you can hang out with that guy.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder),9,S05E09,5
JODI,Did you see the way that he was eating?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)",9,S05E09,5
JODI,"I have to tell you, I really don't like him.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)",9,S05E09,5
JODI,It's just I hate that type.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Yeah, he's a bad seed.",9,S05E09,5
JODI,"Now you however, you, I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry)",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,What are you doing?,9,S05E09,5
JODI,What do you think I'm doing? (he won't get his massage...),9,S05E09,5
[setting,The Chinese restaurant],9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"So, what do you think?",9,S05E09,5
KAREN,Really enjoyed it.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Jody's nice.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,She's very nice. (grabs George's hand) Let's discuss this later.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,Yeah,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,You were extremely personable.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,I didn't pick up anything.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...",9,S05E09,5
KAREN,I didn't see a face.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I tought I saw a face.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,"Anyhow, what is the difference?",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,"George, George, instead of talking about this, we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in 'The Mango' while saying ""instead of the movie..."")",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,He he he he,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,Ah ah ah ah,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,So you think she likes me?,9,S05E09,5
[setting,Elaine's place],9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?,9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Massaging your neck.,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.,9,S05E09,5
JOEL,"Uh, boning up on football? (talking about the magazine she's reading as he sits beside her)",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.",9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Deon Benes?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.",9,S05E09,5
JOEL,D-Deon Rifkin?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!",9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Elaine! What is going on?,9,S05E09,5
[setting,Monk's],9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,She stayed over?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah. (disappointed),9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,The sex wasn't so good?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No. The sex was fabulous.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,So?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I want the massage!,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Did you ask her?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Why not?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,So we had a good time... the four of us.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,What did Jodi say?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,She had a good time.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Is that it?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Pretty much.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"Did she say anything about, uh...",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,What?,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee),9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,You just hesitated.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I was blowing on the coffee.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,She didn't like me?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,So she doesn't like me?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,She said that?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yes.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,She told you she doesn't like me!,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Yes.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,What were her exact--,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"""I don't like him.""",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Not everybody likes everybody!,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,You were very nice!,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,It has nothing to do with her sister.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah",9,S05E09,5

JODI,I was giving Kramer a massage.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous),9,S05E09,5
JODI,I got to run. I have an appointment downtown.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,No that's O.K.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him),9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe),9,S05E09,5
KRAMER,Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!,9,S05E09,5

[setting,street in front of Jerry's building],9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.",9,S05E09,5
JODI,You've never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi),9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)",9,S05E09,5

KRAMER,"(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)",9,S05E09,5

KRAMER,Oh... yeah...,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Enjoyed yourself.,9,S05E09,5

JODI,What are you doing?,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,"Actually, I should get a new one.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)",9,S05E09,5
JODI,"So, where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder)",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.",9,S05E09,5
JODI,"(she stops massaging) No. No, this isn't good. I can't do this.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)",9,S05E09,5
JODI,I can't (she tries harder to pull her hands away),9,S05E09,5
JERRY,No. Yes you can. (he hangs on),9,S05E09,5
JODI,"No, I can't!",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table),9,S05E09,5
[setting,Karen's place],9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.",9,S05E09,5
KAREN,You're going now?,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I think I can still catch her.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,All right George. I have had just about enough of this.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,What? What are you talking about.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,I am talking about you and Jodi. You're completely obsessed with her!,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I know. I know.,9,S05E09,5
KAREN,"Who is more important to you, her or me? I like you, she doesn't. Who are you gonna pick?",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)",9,S05E09,5
KAREN,"Well, now I hate you!",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,That I'm used to. (he leaves),9,S05E09,5
[setting,back to Elaine's place],9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Ned?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,What is wrong with Ned?,9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Ned's a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next!,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Ellis.,9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. It's the same thing!,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,Ellis and Alex aren't even close.,9,S05E09,5
JOEL,NEXT!,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Ohh, what is the point?",9,S05E09,5
JOEL,"NO, NO. COME ON!",9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,O.K. O.K. Remy.,9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret?,9,S05E09,5
ELAINE,"Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.",9,S05E09,5
JOEL,Grrrr!,9,S05E09,5
[setting,back to Jerry's],9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"What do you mean, no?",9,S05E09,5
JODI,No means no.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.",9,S05E09,5
JODI,"Listen. I massage who I want, when I want. I don't submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) I'm getting out of here.",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Fine. Go.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,"Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,What for?,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,We need to talk.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,You need to talk?,9,S05E09,5
JODI,We have nothing to talk about.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.",9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,What?,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,I can see that.,9,S05E09,5
JODI,I'm getting out of here. (to Jerry) Don't call me.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,Don't worry. (she leaves),9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,You're a lucky guy.,9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,I got to go after her.,9,S05E09,5
JERRY,George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods),9,S05E09,5
GEORGE,JODI! (he starts running after her),9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go ""Excuse me, I think you missed a spot.""",9,S05E09,5
JERRY,"You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,How would you describe the smell in this house?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(sniffing) Dandruff?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,There's some kasha.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Alright, let's go, come on.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Wha... you're going?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Egh. These aren't candies.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage),10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Well I'm a guest.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,You're not allowed to have people over?,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps),10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"What, this is a party?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(impatient) Come on!,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,What's the big rush?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I'm having people over.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Who?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,(interested) Really?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I'll put in a good word for you.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,(screaming) Aaahh!!,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"But Jerry, this is not coming out!",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Just put a coffee table book over it.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Now?!,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Alright, we'll take the subway.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,There you go. That'll get you home in time.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Oh! The subway? From Queens?,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I need something to read on the subway.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(looks at it) TV Guide?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,(claps hands) Yes indeed.,10,S05E10,5
TANNOY (V.O.),"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(laughing) No thanks.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Alright, but no bites.",10,S05E10,5
RICKY,Highlighter?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Excuse me?,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.",10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,(yells) Elaine!,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,He's not my boyfriend.,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,He's not? (thoughtful) Interesting.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Why?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Can't hurt you.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"What about, what about this thing?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,The Indian?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.",10,S05E10,5
GEPETTO,"Well, I can have the table ready for you on Monday.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.",10,S05E10,5
GEPETTO,"They left you home alone, huh?",10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday (he swaps seats and sits beside Elaine) you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.",10,S05E10,5
RICKY,(after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!,10,S05E10,5
GEPETTO,"They don't make these any more. The work is, is all done by hand. (Sylvia enters the store behind him) Takes years, and years, and... (notices) Sylvia! For crying out, you're forty-five minutes late!",10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"Yeah, yeah. (to George, smiling) Is that your car out there?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)",10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"Oh, nice. You guys are obviously from Manhattan.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.",10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"Really? Ah, I didn't think any cool guys lived in this neighborhood.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Alright, I'll take it.",10,S05E10,5
GEPETTO,Smart choice.,10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"Wow, you bought the Indian? Oh, you guys have great taste.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces,10,S05E10,5
THE GIRLS,(disappointed) Oh/Aah.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Who is it?,10,S05E10,5

GIRL (NOT WINONA),"Elaine, is it your birthday?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,No.,10,S05E10,5

THE GIRLS,Aww/That's so sweet. (general murmur of approval),10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Are you ready?,10,S05E10,5

JERRY,It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Read it out loud.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"I, I don't think so.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.,10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"(gathering her stuff) Hey, you know, it's late. I really should go.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Are you out of your mind?!,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Winona is a Native American.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,She is?,10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,You got very unusual taste.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.,10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,Fine.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.,10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,(regarding photo) Ahh! Is this your son in the bubble bath?,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"(bashful) No, that's me.",10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,Oh. You don't see many guys your age who keep baby pictures of themselves around. (laughs) I like it. Consistent with the rest of the house.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.",10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,What is this we're listening to?,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle),10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"Mmmm, what's that smell? Kasha?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)",10,S05E10,5
WINONA (O.C.),Who is it?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,(unimpressed) Yeah?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,I'll come down.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,I came by to get my ball.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,It's right over there.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,You want it?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,(unbelieving) I can have this?!,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Oh. I'll lug.,10,S05E10,5
WINONA,It's just that it's a very sensitive issue for me.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,(smiling) I guess I could go for a bite.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.",10,S05E10,5
MAILMAN,"Why must I know? Because I'm Chinese? You think I know where all the Chinese restaurants are? (adopts hackneyed Chinese accent) Oh, ask honorable Chinaman for location of restaurant.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.",10,S05E10,5
MAILMAN,"Oh, hello American Joe. Which way to hamburger, hotdog stand? (storms away)",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,I didn't know that...,10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"You know, it's late. I should probably just go home.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"I, I had no idea.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops),10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Looks pretty good.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Yeah, did a good job.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.",10,S05E10,5

FRANK,Where's the mail?,10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,Hello Jerry.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Hello.,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"So, how was the trip?",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,"Ah, your father...",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,Is there anything wrong with getting a receipt at a toll booth?,10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,I'm going upstairs. (she leaves for the bedroom),10,S05E10,5
FRANK,"(examining mail) This stack should be bigger, where's the TV Guide?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,What TV Guide?,10,S05E10,5
FRANK,"I'm missing TV Guide volume forty-one, number thirty-one.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,Elaine took it?,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,I didn't know she took it!,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Wa, it's two weeks old.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,(shouting) How could you let her take the TV Guide?!,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,(to Jerry) He collects them.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,You collect TV Guide?,10,S05E10,5
FRANK,"The nerve of that woman. Walking into my house, stealing my collectible!",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,(screaming) Oh my God! (she enters holding a small packet) This was in our bed.,10,S05E10,5
FRANK,(taking the packet) What is this? (accusingly to George) A prophylactic wrapper?!,10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,What is this doing on my bed?!,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"I don't know, uh...",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste),10,S05E10,5
FRANK,You were having sex on our bed?!,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Yes!,10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,"Who told you, you could have sex in our bed?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,"Your bed is too small? I'm gone two weeks and you turn our house into, into Bourbon Street!",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,Where am I going to sleep?,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,What are you talking about?,10,S05E10,5

GEORGE,Of course you can.,10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,I can't! (screams) I can't!,10,S05E10,5
FRANK,That's it! You're grounded!,10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,"(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,You wanna live here? You respect the rules of our house. (yells) You're grounded!,10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"So, where are we gonna go eat?",10,S05E10,5

JERRY,"Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,From who?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"A uh, one of those guys.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,What guys?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,Oh.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,That's Al Roker.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"Sure, take it.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Thanks.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,He collects (holds up magazine) these?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Yeah.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.",10,S05E10,5

ELAINE,I dunno.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Hi.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,What did who say?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Uhmm...,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I would be embarrassed to bring it up.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Where you going?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,My Indian?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,How do you just walk into a house and take a TV Guide? How does she expect you to watch TV? (doorbell rings) Am I just supposed to turn it on and wander aimlessly around the dial?,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,Hello. Is Elaine home?,10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,"Elaine Benes? Oh, she's my son's friend.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,(shouting) And she's not welcome in this house!,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"(entering) Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,(yelling) That's my TV Guide! Ripped to shreds! She gave that to you?!,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"(seeing TV) Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?",10,S05E10,5
GEORGE,Yeah.,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"Oh, this is a good one.",10,S05E10,5
TANNOY (V.O.),"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE (V.O.),"Mmm, gyro.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,I like your place. It's very unassuming.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"(laughs) Oh, by the way. That TV Guide I gave you, I need it back.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Why?,10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"Well, I'm doing a report on minorities in the media, and I wanted to use that interview with Al Roker.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"Jerry, I really need it back. It, it is mine.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,What?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"A uh, a person that uh...",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,A person that what?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,And?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.",10,S05E10,5
WINONA,"You mean like, an Indian giver?!",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.",10,S05E10,5
RICKY,I like the special fall preview issues the best.,10,S05E10,5
FRANK,Those. I've been saving those from the beginning.,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"These are worth like, a lot of money.",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,"Oh, hello Elaine!",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Hello. (she enters),10,S05E10,5
RICKY,(jumping to his feet) Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.,10,S05E10,5
FRANK,Why'd you take my TV Guide?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)",10,S05E10,5
RICKY,I made this for you.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,(examining magazine) What is this? You got stains all over it! What the hell'd you do?,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"Hey, you can't talk to her like that.",10,S05E10,5
FRANK,(yelling) I'll talk to her any way I want!,10,S05E10,5
RICKY,"Come on Elaine, let's go.",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,My coffee table!,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.",10,S05E10,5
SPIKE,I'll give you a box of Coronas for it.,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Forget it.,10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"Uh, excuse me. Are you uh, selling this Indian?",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah.",10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"Uh, I'm just uh, redecorating my office in a south-western motif and this'd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it?",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Giddyup.,10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"Yeah? Could you help me bring it up to my office, I'm right next door. Pendant Publishing.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,"Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, hi Elaine.",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,What are you doing in here with that?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Ah, well, it's a business transaction.",10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"(entering, smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh, petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead, count it.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.",10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"You like that, huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe.",10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,You mind if I use it in my book?,10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,What book?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.",10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,About coffee tables?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,Uh huh.,10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,That's fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Who's your publisher?,10,S05E10,5
KRAMER,"Well, I'm still shopping it around.",10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"Yeah? (to Elaine) You see, this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway?",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...,10,S05E10,5
LIPPMAN,"(ignoring Elaine) God, that Indian really completes the room. Don't you think?",10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"I know this coffee table, it's George Costanza's.",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,It's mine. I'm his mother.,10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,"Oh, I haven't seen George for a while. He must be working very hard.",10,S05E10,5
ESTELLE,George doesn't work. He's a bum. That's why he lives at home with us.,10,S05E10,5
SYLVIA,He does?,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I dunno.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)",10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I guess.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,What's the matter?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.,10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"It is a good idea, Elaine.",10,S05E10,5
TANNOY (V.O.),"Next stop, Queensboro Plaza.",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,You want a gyro?,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,I don't think so.,10,S05E10,5
[Subway train,moments later],10,S05E10,5
JERRY,Elaine!,10,S05E10,5
AL ROKER,Guess your boyfriend's gonna have to catch the next train.,10,S05E10,5
ELAINE,He's not my boyfriend.,10,S05E10,5
AL ROKER,He's not? Interesting. (gives a big grin),10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?",10,S05E10,5
JERRY,"You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? ""I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out."" I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. ""Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion."" After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.",11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.",11,S05E11,5
SASHA,Twenty five dollars.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.",11,S05E11,5
SASHA,"George, George, uh, I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem.",11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,We do?,11,S05E11,5
SASHA,We cant keep seeing each other.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Why?,11,S05E11,5
SASHA,"(crying) Because its over. (sob, sob, sob) Its my parents George, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever forgive me? (sob)",11,S05E11,5
WAITER,"Uh, have you decided yet?",11,S05E11,5
SASHA,(crying) Yes. Ill have the lobster.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Then he asked you out?,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,On your heart?,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"Jerry, the man is a doctor.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"So, its the same thing.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,Really?,11,S05E11,5
TAWNI,Hello.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Oh hi.,11,S05E11,5
TAWNI,Are you going to be stopping by later?,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,"Yes, Ill be stopping.",11,S05E11,5
TAWNI,"Ok, see you later.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs),11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Its over.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,What?,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,How did you get in?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Kramer.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,Whats that? (points at some foil on the table),11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Lobster.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Looks like a swan.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,She says we cant go out anymore.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,Why?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,"Oh, whatever.",11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"Mmm, this is delicious.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,"Mmm, succulent.",11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.",11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,Why dont you just ask her parents?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,To Latvian Orthodox?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Why not? What do I care?,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,You know its not like changing toothpaste.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,I think it would be romantic.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Really?,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.",11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,George I was just kidding around.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,George I wasnt serious.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.",11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,I guess this one is my fault.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Oh yeah.,11,S05E11,5
TAWNI,"(kiss, kiss, kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser?",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,"Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.",11,S05E11,5
TAWNI,Well it was worth it. (kiss) Ill be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you going?,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.,11,S05E11,5
TAWNI,Meet you back here?,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Right there.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,"(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) ""Fungicide"". Fungus?",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Fungicide. I mean what could she have?,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,I dont know.,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,Fungus.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Exactly,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,So what did you say?,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,"I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?",11,S05E11,5
JERRY,I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,You were snooping.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,I would. I always open medicine cabinets.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,Well I trust people not to do that.,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,Big mistake.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,I am not going to ask him about funguses.,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,Fungi.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,What?,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,Fungi.,11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,Enigmatic?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,No.,11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,"Vast? (he pronounces it as ""vost"")",11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"No not vast (he pronounces it as ""vost"")",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,"Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.",11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Yes.,11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST 2,Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly attractive?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.,11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,Plot?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST 2,Well its obvious that you are sincere in your desire.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books).,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?",11,S05E11,5
SISTER ROBERTA,"Oh Im sorry. Father, theres a man waiting in the chapel.",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,"You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church.",11,S05E11,5
SISTER ROBERTA,Oh are you? Thats wonderful. Well good luck to you.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Nice nun.,11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST,"No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice.",11,S05E11,5
FATHER-PRIEST 2,She wont be taking her final vows until next Thursday.,11,S05E11,5
SISTER ROBERTA,May I help you?,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.",11,S05E11,5

JERRY,Thats all there is to it.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Oh a slinky.,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,Sister Roberta gave it to me.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,Why did she give you that?,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,I think she liked me.,11,S05E11,5
JERRY,What do you mean she liked you?,11,S05E11,5
KRAMER,Liked me.,11,S05E11,5
GEORGE,"Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.",11,S05E11,5

JERRY,How could you say that?,11,S05E11,5
ELAINE,Its you fault. You just got me thinking.,11,S05E11,5

JERRY,"But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, ""Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on.""",11,S05E11,5

JERRY,The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.,12,S05E12,5
ELAINE,"Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here",12,S05E12,5

ELAINE,3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!,12,S05E12,5
JANE,"she wouldn't stop ""help me! help me!"" she was insane",12,S05E12,5
ELAINE,"I was begging her ""please! please!"" she was insane",12,S05E12,5
JERRY,who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out,12,S05E12,5

JANE,"(to Kramer, in a very sensual voice) you either",12,S05E12,5
JERRY,"Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going ""boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.""",12,S05E12,5
ELAINE,"Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,I once got Happy New Yeared in March.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,It's disgusting.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Really cold.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Scary cold.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,That. (pointing at George),13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,What?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,When did you get that?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Look at this,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom),13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,What for?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Why?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Because it's rude, otherwise.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Yes.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,The fabric of society is very complex George.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves),13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Why not?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Because we're adults?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"All right, let's go. Who's driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together)",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George),13,S05E13,5

ELAINE,"Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Oh, here we go...",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,What?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,(low tone)Yeahhehehehe,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"(low tone) All right, yeah.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Ring Dings?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Ooooh I like Ring Dings.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window),13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,(low tone) All right.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Jerry.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here in ten minutes.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Yeah.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,All right,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Mmm.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,I'm looking forward to it.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Love that babka.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah!",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Why?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,You think it's effeminate?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,It's a tad dainty.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Oh, we forgot to pick a number.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Ah, no, forget it.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"(exhales) Well, I'm not finding a spot here. What do you want to do?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Ah, Just double park.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"No, no.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Why not?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"I'll get a ticket! Besides, what if somebody wants to get out of here?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,That's a fallacy.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heat 'll be on.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Does the heater even work in this car?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,No.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,I see.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"You see, hu, ho ho.",13,S05E13,5

DAVID,"Well, that's easy for you to say.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.",13,S05E13,5
CLERK,46?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?",13,S05E13,5
BARBARA,Yes.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.",13,S05E13,5
BARBARA,I'm on my way over there right now.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Yeah me too.,13,S05E13,5
DAVID,You're Jerry right?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,David!,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?",13,S05E13,5
BARBARA,Yes it is.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"You know we were here, ahead of you.",13,S05E13,5
BARBARA,You're NOT getting my number.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Oh so you still don't believe us.,13,S05E13,5
CLERK,47!,13,S05E13,5

BARBARA,"Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what a jerk YOU are. . . . (turns to the counter) I'll have the chocolate babka.",13,S05E13,5
CLERK,You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Ooo, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,What's that?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Well its a Bordeaux. Robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh, here's one. Twelve dollars.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,. . . Why not?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips),13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,I never take it.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,So what do you do?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Oh, I get by.",13,S05E13,5
BARBARA,See you later (exits with the babka),13,S05E13,5
ELAINE & JERRY,See you later.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,That's the last babka. They got the last babka.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,I know. They're going in first with the last babka.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,That was our babka.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,You can't beat a babka.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,We had that babka.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,(exhales) They're going to be heroes.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Well how about a carrot cake?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Black Forrest?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,How about a Napoleon?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,That was our babka. We had that babka!,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,What's this one?,13,S05E13,5

ELAINE,"No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.",13,S05E13,5
CLERK,49?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,I'll have a cinnamon babka.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!",13,S05E13,5

GEORGE,Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,What?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Alright, Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,I am not buying something just to get change.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"All right, what are we doing?",13,S05E13,5

GEORGE,Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill),13,S05E13,5
CLERK,What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.,13,S05E13,5

CLERK,You got to buy more than that.,13,S05E13,5

GEORGE,I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Why? No, thatll make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the letters at the dinner table.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Oh, that's nice.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Come on, did you ever read one of these?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,It's not real. They're all made up.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Ohh, it's real.",13,S05E13,5

KRAMER,You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,(looking in the box) Well what is this?,13,S05E13,5

CLERK,You have to take a number.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Well it was a little hair. I took it off.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,What if it's your hair?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,What if it's your hair?,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive),13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"(reading from the Penthouse Forum) ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true"" (exits to street) "" A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was""",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,L-Look at this?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Ahh.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"""well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out."" (turns the page)",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"No, no I can't comprehend it?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"How about Idi Amin, huh?",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Are those shoes comfortable?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,No not really.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Cause they look comfortable.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,No. Thats out of the question.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Whhhy?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,What happened?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,I'd rather not talk about it.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,You can't tell me?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.,13,S05E13,5

ELAINE,What happened?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Well I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?,13,S05E13,5

KRAMER,What about her?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,. . . I'm a little scared of her.,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,You're scared of Elaine?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Yes!,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Why?,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.",13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,"Hey, let's go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here.",13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?,13,S05E13,5
KRAMER,Because I wanted to look good for the party.,13,S05E13,5
GEORGE,"Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!",13,S05E13,5

GEORGE,I wasn't talking to you.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,"Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.",13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"Huh, wa?",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,What's the matter with you?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,"I dont know, I don't feel so good.",13,S05E13,5

JERRY,"My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.",13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,The black and white?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Yeah.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,Not getting along?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.,13,S05E13,5
ELAINE,(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?,13,S05E13,5
JERRY,Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.,13,S05E13,5

ELAINE,"I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"What, what is it?",14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,"The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)",14,S05E14,5

JERRY,So?,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,So?,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,So what do you have to say for yourself?,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,So what do you have to say for yourself?,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Why should I have anything for say for myself?,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"""War-- What is it good for?""!",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,"You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book ""War-- What Is IT Good For?""?",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Can I take a guess?,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"Oh, Please.",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,"Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"What, how did you know that?",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Because I know who has it.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,(gasps) How did you find it?,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,"Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,I don't have it!,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,Why not.,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,One million.,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Well that's a start.,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.",14,S05E14,5
DIANE,Uh-Really?,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.",14,S05E14,5
DIANE,Wow.,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)",14,S05E14,5

ELAINE,"Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,"Well, you want your organizer back don't you?",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"Well, you're not Superman.",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Well you're not Lois Lane.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.),14,S05E14,5

DIANE,What are those people doing over there?,14,S05E14,5
TESTIKOV,"(In a loud and cranky voice) What, Come in - come in - Come in Miss Benes! That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment?",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,"Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)",14,S05E14,5

HOTEL CLERK,Well you can wait for them outside.,14,S05E14,5
CORINNE,"Yeah, (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) I guess I'd better. I wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers!",14,S05E14,5
HOTEL CLERK,"All right, All right. Out, Out.",14,S05E14,5
CORINNE,"Whatever you say, Cro..w-well!",14,S05E14,5

JERRY,youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic),14,S05E14,5
TESTIKOV,Ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief),14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?",14,S05E14,5
TESTIKOV,(quietly) yes. How could I forget? heehe.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov),14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away),14,S05E14,5

CROWD,Come on! Save the whale! You gotta do it!,14,S05E14,5
DIANE,Save the whale George... for me.,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!",14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!",14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,I know I was just telling them the story.,14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,"Well come on George, finish the story.",14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, ""Easy big fella!"" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Mammal.,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,Whatever.,14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,"Well then, what did you do next?",14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!",14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,What is that a Titleist?,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer),14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,A hole in one eh.,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me",14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,(quietly) Um-hm.,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Wow! What'd she say?,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,"Told me to ""Go to hell!"" and I took the bus home.",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,All right lets go.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,"What, are you in a bad mood?",14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Ahhh got my laundry back.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,Ohhh! Golden Boy?,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,He didn't make it.,14,S05E14,5
ELAINE,I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm),14,S05E14,5
JERRY,Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.,14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,(to George) What's with you?,14,S05E14,5
GEORGE,Sand. It's everywhere,14,S05E14,5
KRAMER,Yep.,14,S05E14,5
JERRY,"Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. ""What ever happened to Bob?"" ""Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face."" Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. ""Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived.""",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Hum! That was really good!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Yeah. are you full?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"Oh no, I've had just enough.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,No thanks.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,You're not gonna have any?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,No (with a disgusted face),15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Do you not like apple pie?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"No, it's not that.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Well, at least taste it.",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"No (a resolute ""no"")",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,You won't even taste it?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,No.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing ""no"") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,She wouldn't so much as taste it.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Did she say why?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey),15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Maybe she's diabetic.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Maybe you said something that offended her.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Like at the airport? (getting excited),15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Yeah.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,That's a great idea!!!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Tell me about it!,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,We could be zipping all over the place.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,They could at least try it.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,They never try anything.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,What's the harm?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,No harm!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Who wouldn't taste a pie?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Audrey.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Dump her.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,You did?,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,I got a pebble.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,What the hell does that mean?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture),15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,What? Why?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Do it. Do it. This.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Like... (doing it) Like this?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Oh yeah! It's you!,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,What's me?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Get out!,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?",15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing),15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?",15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Real Boss!,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,I'm going down there.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,All right. All right. (They both leave),15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Keep it. (implied please),15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,It looks exactly like me.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,What's going on here? How do you think this happened?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,(european accent) You are perfect for that suit.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,You think so?,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,I don't know.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,You really think this looks O.K. on me?,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,"I told you, I don't know.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,Why?,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,What is her problem?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,Yes.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,"I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,"Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to the other customers.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.",15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Well, how did they get your face?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.,15,S05E15,5
WOMAN 1,That's right.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,And you waved it away.,15,S05E15,5
WOMAN 2,Right.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Did you give her a reason?,15,S05E15,5
WOMAN 2,"Yes, I was full.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.,15,S05E15,5
WOMAN 2,"No, I'm not a psycho.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,We certainly have.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Hey, Elaine scratch my back.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,No way!,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Come on, one lap around.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,No.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,It will be a funky adventure.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"Kramer, forget it.",15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Jerry, how about you?",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,I think you know my policy.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier),15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,I thought George was meeting us here?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,No he's going downtown to guard the suit.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,He's guarding a suit?,15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,(the cashier; to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.",15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,Turn around.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,(makes a guy trying the suit) It fits you perfectly.,15,S05E15,5
BOB,You think so? (she nods and walks away),15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?",15,S05E15,5
BOB,I'm buying the suit.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)",15,S05E15,5
BOB,"Excuse me, do you work here?",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs),15,S05E15,5
BOB,Then what the hell business is it of yours?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.",15,S05E15,5
BOB,Really?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Yea Yea Yea,15,S05E15,5
BOB,This Monday?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Yes. Now take off those pants.,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,"Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday.",15,S05E15,5
BOB,Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves),15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Everything is delicious.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,You've tasted them?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"Um-hmm, I think almost all of them.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Oh I see they have apple pie.,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Mmm-hmm.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,You've had the apple pie?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Many times.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Can we drop this?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Ah! Poppie.,15,S05E15,5
POPPIE,"Sweetheart, hello.",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"Poppie, this is Jerry.",15,S05E15,5
POPPIE,Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand),15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Hello Poppie.,15,S05E15,5
POPPIE,Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves),15,S05E15,5
JERRY,The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves),15,S05E15,5
[Poppie's Restaurant,Bathroom],15,S05E15,5
POPPIE,"Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey.",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Jerry are you OK?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Huh?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,Is anything wrong?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"No, Nothing.",15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,You look like you've seen a ghost.,15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,(to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Hey. These are for you Olive.,15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,Thank you.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Ohh!,15,S05E15,5
POPPIE,Here it is.,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect.",15,S05E15,5
POPPIE,(to Jerry) Well?,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,"Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing ""no"") You're not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking)",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,So she tought I did it to get back at her,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Why didn't you just tell her?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,How could he not have washed?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, just like I do.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,We haven't spoken.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Olive?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Oh.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Is that Elaine mannequin still there?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Yeah.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,Yeah.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"The last time I saw her, she was naked.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...",15,S05E15,5
BOB,Where is it? Where is it?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.",15,S05E15,5
BOB,You bastard! You hid the suit.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.",15,S05E15,5
BOB,"I hope you rot in that suit. Look I'm gonna get you for this. I don't know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay!",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Because you have an attitude.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY and ELAINE,Oh!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Georgio! Nice duds!,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Did you hear something?,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, like a swoosh.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Yeah.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,So what? What would they care?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.",15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Audrey?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Was it apple?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,What else?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!,15,S05E15,5
STRANGER,Do I know you?,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Hmm... No you don't.,15,S05E15,5
STRANGER,Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,The mannequin!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Oh, I got to see this thing.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,"It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want with it.",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.",15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,(to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Uh-huh,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,The Charlie Macarthy hearings.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?,15,S05E15,5
SALESWOMAN,I'm getting the manager. (she leaves),15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin),15,S05E15,5
JERRY,What are you doing?,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Just get the car!,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?",15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,Where are you going?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Poppie's,15,S05E15,5
MACKENZIE,"Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) Did you hear something?",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"No, I didn't hear anything.",15,S05E15,5
MACKENZIE,"Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything?",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,"No, can't say as I did.",15,S05E15,5
MACKENZIE,Kind of like a... rustling.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Could be the leaves...,15,S05E15,5

JERRY,The apple pie you had today at Monks,15,S05E15,5
AUDREY,I'm very busy here.,15,S05E15,5

AUDREY,What do they want from Poppie?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.",15,S05E15,5
MACKENZIE,You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing?,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.,15,S05E15,5
MACKENZIE,"No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, you're in the wrong place.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.,15,S05E15,5
WAITER,Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house.,15,S05E15,5
MACKENZIE,Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert.,15,S05E15,5

MACKENZIE,"Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing ""no"") Well, take a bite. It's delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking)",15,S05E15,5
BUSINESSMAN,"If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.",15,S05E15,5
JERRY,So you didn't get the job.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,"Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.",15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,What am I supposed to say?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Tell her you lost your itch.,15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,What happened to your itch?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,Well you should tell her.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.",15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,What?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Uh, well, there's someone else.",15,S05E15,5

OLIVE,her?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.",15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend.,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.",15,S05E15,5
OLIVE,Why is she wearing her underwear?,15,S05E15,5
KRAMER,"Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.",15,S05E15,5
GEORGE,Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?,15,S05E15,5
JERRY,No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.,15,S05E15,5
ELAINE,"You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?",15,S05E15,5
RICKY'S BOSS,"Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin.",15,S05E15,5
RICKY,TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.,15,S05E15,5

You ever notice when you get behind the bus, people in your car go 'what are you doing? get away, come on.' The back of the bus is like an eclipse isn't it? people are just like 'the sun, where's the sun?' It's like this huge metal ass taking up the whole wind shield of your car.

GEORGE,Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.,16,S05E16,5
JERRY,Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?,16,S05E16,5
GEORGE,She knows there is nothing to talk about.,16,S05E16,5

FULTON,I haven't cracked a smile in months.,16,S05E16,5
JERRY,"Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other.

DAPHNE,He told me not to get involved with you.,16,S05E16,5

DAPHNE,"Ya, he said you could never make a commitment to any one and you'd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps George's hand) hurting me.",16,S05E16,5

JERRY,"But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,I'll get the short stack.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.,17,S05E17,5

JERRY,"Oh, wow.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have left of her.,17,S05E17,5

MERYL,"Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY (to Jerry),I didn't know you were married.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY (to Meryl),"Sure, you get the discount, too.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,I'm taking him to the cleaners!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Oh, hi Greg.",17,S05E17,5
GREG,Haven't seen you in a while.,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.",17,S05E17,5

ELAINE,"No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Well, I-I gotta take off.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?",17,S05E17,5
GREG (looks at his watch),Eleven-thirty.,17,S05E17,5

JERRY,"Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)",17,S05E17,5
OWNER (points at the bottle of maple syrup),Excuse me...where did you get that?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"I, uh...well...",17,S05E17,5
OWNER,"Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the restaurant. (To Jerry) And if I catch you in here with that again...I will confiscate it.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"No, just Meryl.",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Why, why? Why does she get it?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,(on buzzer) Meh.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying ""my wife."" Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - ""my wife"" this, ""my wife"" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"""My wife has an inner ear infection.""",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,See?,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Alright. (Elaine enters.),17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Let's make it fifty.,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,The fly-boy.,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Yeah.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Hmm, So?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Really.,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Ohhh, moisture?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Yeah. Definite moisture.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"That's an open-lip kiss, alright.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE (on intercom),"Oh, uh...it's George.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Hey, what happened to you?",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE (meekly),Nothing...little problem.,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE (to Jerry),"I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Yeah, so?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Yeah? What was it?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE (defensive),"Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I had to go, so...",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Here we go.,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,You went...in the shower?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE (to Jerry),Do you go in the shower?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"No, never.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE (to Kramer),Do you?,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,I take baths.,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Did you ever hear of...holding it in?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,How do you know?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,Medical journals!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Hello.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Oh, hi...honey.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,What are you doing here?,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,I just thought I'd drop off a few things.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,Another quilt? Huh? (Uncle Leo enters.),17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,Jerry!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Uncle Leo?!,17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,Hello!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Hello.,17,S05E17,5
MARTY (to Jerry),"So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, it should be ready.",17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,Your wife?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY (hoping Leo will pick up on the scam),Yeah...my wife.,17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Uh...I got married.,17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO (shocked),You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Well, it was sudden.",17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"No, no, it was a small ceremony.",17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,Haven't I always been a good uncle?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Yes, yes, you have.",17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,Who told you when you went to school that you print well?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"You did, you did.",17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO (to Meryl),"When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm a good printer.,17,S05E17,5
UNCLE LEO,"I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Uncle Leo, wait!",17,S05E17,5
GREG,I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,I can find out.,17,S05E17,5
GREG,Would ya?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"By the way, you look really great in that leotard.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last night.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...",17,S05E17,5
GREG,Can I have a sip of your water?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Thanks. (Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.)",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.,17,S05E17,5
GREG (hands the bottle back),"I'm sorry, what were you saying?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)",17,S05E17,5
GREG,See that guy right there?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Yup, you mean him?",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"I caught him urinating in the shower. I'm thinking about turning him in, too.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,Honey? Could you get me something to drink?,17,S05E17,5
"JERRY (from his bedroom hallway, alluding to the fact that she should get the drink herself)",You're right there.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"C'mon, I'm sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show she's watching.)",17,S05E17,5
JERRY (looking in a drawer),"Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,I didn't do anything with it.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,It's in the first drawer.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Yes, it is.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY (irritated),"Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, there's no can opener.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,Did I say you were stupid?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY (angrily),"Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.)",17,S05E17,5
MERYL (getting up),Do you want me to go find it?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY (slams the drawer),"Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! I'm sorry, I'm just fighting with my wife.",17,S05E17,5
HELEN,"Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?",17,S05E17,5
MORTY,Why the hell didn't you tell us?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Listen, Ma...",17,S05E17,5
MERYL (looking in the drawer),It was in here yesterday!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY (angrily),"Yeah, that's what I said!",17,S05E17,5
HELEN,Who is she? When did this happen?,17,S05E17,5
MORTY (to Jerry),I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never do it.,17,S05E17,5
HELEN,"Morty, you're talking too loud.",17,S05E17,5
MORTY,I'm not talking loud!,17,S05E17,5
HELEN,You're hurting my eardrum.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL (looking for the can opener),"Well, you must have done something with it!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY (to Meryl),I'm on the phone!,17,S05E17,5
HELEN,Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Mom, I'm not married.",17,S05E17,5
HELEN,What?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm not married!,17,S05E17,5
MORTY,"I knew it, I told you!",17,S05E17,5
HELEN (to Jerry),Uncle Leo said.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.,17,S05E17,5
HELEN,A discount on dry-cleaning?,17,S05E17,5
"JERRY (to Meryl, who's making a racket in the kitchen looking for the can opener)","Could you make a little more noise? (To his parents) Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL (not finding the opener),"Well, I give up.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,Got any coffee?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.),17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,Huh?,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,That?,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Yeah, me too. I Love you.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I Love you.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Well, goodnight.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,So what do you want me to do?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,Talk to him!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,How can I do that?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE (enunciating clearly so George gets the point),"Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Well, that doesn't mean anything!",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY (patiently while watching tv),"She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,Why?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,I...I don't know...,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"No, that's not it!",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Why couldn't you just wait?,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,I was there! I saw a drain!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Since when is a drain a toilet?!,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,It's all pipes! What's the difference?!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.),17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE (to George),"Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Alright.,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Well, you gotta pick it up for me!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,I'm so tired!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE (to Kramer),"Boy, you don't look good.",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,Huh? I don't?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"No, you look pale.",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.),17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.)",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?,17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"Who the hell are you? Huh, It's not your quilt.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.",17,S05E17,5
"KRAMER (angrily, to Jerry)",Maybe.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.",17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Alright, I'm gonna see you later.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Where you goin'?,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,"Hey, that's how I maintain my glow.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm goin' home.,17,S05E17,5
KRAMER,Ya.,17,S05E17,5
"PAULA (to Marty, in a foreign accent)","Excuse me? Uh, how much would it cost to clean this?",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"Oh, about thirteen dollars.",17,S05E17,5
PAULA,"Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"Well, I'm sorry.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Hi, Greg.",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)",17,S05E17,5
GREG (to Elaine),"Oh, well, It's all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine, then George runs over.)",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,What happened? Did he bring it up?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,Signal? What signal?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.",17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Yeah! It's a social thing.,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,"What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,No! I won't be a party to this.,17,S05E17,5
GEORGE,So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)",17,S05E17,5
PAULA,I won't let you do this!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I want to!,17,S05E17,5
PAULA,But it isn't right! I can't.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Give me the clothes.,17,S05E17,5
PAULA,"Jerry, please. What about her?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)",17,S05E17,5
PAULA,"No, Jerry, please!",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.,17,S05E17,5
PAULA (hands over the clothes),I can't fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.),17,S05E17,5
JERRY,Do you want box or hanger?,17,S05E17,5
PAULA,You decide. (Jerry considers.),17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh, there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, you know, we cannot have people like that in here.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,Are you sure you want to do that?,17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk to her.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.),17,S05E17,5
GREG,Very.,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",17,S05E17,5
GREG,Why?,17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?",17,S05E17,5
GREG,"Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?",17,S05E17,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes to $17.80.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Here you go. (Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me, this isn't mine.",17,S05E17,5
MARTY,"Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.),17,S05E17,5
ANNA,"That's him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.)",17,S05E17,5
MERYL (throws Paula's clothes at Jerry),You son of a bitch!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'm sorry.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,Who is she? I want to know who she is.,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"Yes, that's right.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"What happened to us, Jerry?",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,I'll tell you what happened. We got married.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"I'm sorry, uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,"It's alright, I want you to have it.",17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"(sentimental) Okay, thanks.",17,S05E17,5
JERRY,We'll always have...pancakes.,17,S05E17,5
MERYL,"Bye, Jerry. (Exits.)",17,S05E17,5
GRANDPA (to Anna),I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!,17,S05E17,5
JERRY,You know their timing couldn't be worse.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,When are they leaving for Paris?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Not for another three days.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,What about her place?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,She lives with her parents.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.",18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?",18,S05E18,5
JERRY,The baldies,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.",18,S05E18,5
ALEC,(walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Hey Alec,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Hey Alec,18,S05E18,5
ALEC,This is Joey.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Hey Joey, how you doin'?",18,S05E18,5
ALEC,"(Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Well uh....,18,S05E18,5
JOEY,(interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like me? Please?,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.",18,S05E18,5
ALEC,"That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you.",18,S05E18,5
JOEY,Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..,18,S05E18,5
ALEC,"(grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go (walking over to the counter) See ya.",18,S05E18,5
JERRY,What happened?,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"Ya, it's much better isn't it?",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Oh, n-no comparison.",18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.,18,S05E18,5

GEORGE,Your parents are going to Paris right?,18,S05E18,5

GEORGE,So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,What about little Joey?,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Who?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"Ah, I think he's probably better off.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,But there are no stamps on these.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.",18,S05E18,5
HELEN,Why are you doing this?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.,18,S05E18,5
HELEN,Why?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.,18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,"Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?",18,S05E18,5
HELEN,I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion),18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,(putting on the lotion) Ya,18,S05E18,5
HELEN,It's from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.,18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember that if I'm ever in Florida.,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.",18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,Ya,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at home.,18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,"Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?",18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,"Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?",18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,Well I suppose the children do.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.,18,S05E18,5

MORTY,Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Oh sure like Monet.,18,S05E18,5

JERRY,"Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.",18,S05E18,5

KRAMER,Now what is Executive?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,"I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, these haven't been made in twenty years.",18,S05E18,5
HELEN,Why would they? Know body bought them then.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,He's wearing one.,18,S05E18,5

MORTY,You gotta deal.,18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,Yaaaa.,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,"I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery.",18,S05E18,5
HELEN,You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris in three days.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,He'll send them express.,18,S05E18,5
HELEN,You're crazy.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,"I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats.",18,S05E18,5
JERRY,N-na I'm paying for the trip.,18,S05E18,5

ALEC,"George, you have no idea how fantastic this is.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,Fantastic?,18,S05E18,5
ALEC,"Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect solution.",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,How gee what a coincidence.,18,S05E18,5
ALEC,And you'll send me a postcard.,18,S05E18,5
AARON,Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children.,18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,Mm hmm.,18,S05E18,5
AARON,"And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him",18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,Aaron,18,S05E18,5
AARON,Yes?,18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,"Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?",18,S05E18,5
AARON,"Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy it.",18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,"Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?",18,S05E18,5
AARON,"No, it was fun.",18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.,18,S05E18,5
AARON,"Yea, they bought me a coke.",18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,"I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.",18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,How serendipitous.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.,18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,Mmm,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.,18,S05E18,5
KRAMER,Did you call Jack Klompus yet?,18,S05E18,5

ESTELLE,"Well they better come, I got all this Paella.",18,S05E18,5
FRANK,"I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.",18,S05E18,5

FRANK,"Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never be comfortable again.",18,S05E18,5
ESTELLE,Alright Frank that's enough.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing),18,S05E18,5

RUDY,Look I gotta be honest with you there's nothing here too spectacular.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,"Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.",18,S05E18,5
RUDY,I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes.,18,S05E18,5

GEORGE,Hey could you do one other thing for me?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Name it.,18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps),18,S05E18,5
JERRY,"So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?",18,S05E18,5
GEORGE,(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.,18,S05E18,5

HELEN,Well he told you about the place.,18,S05E18,5

MORTY,Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.,18,S05E18,5

ELAINE,"N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?",18,S05E18,5
JERRY,It is a tad askew.,18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,I've hardly been out to dinner with them.,18,S05E18,5
ELAINE,"See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.",18,S05E18,5

ELAINE,Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?,18,S05E18,5

NEWMAN,Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean.,18,S05E18,5
HELEN,I'm afraid I don't.,18,S05E18,5
NEWMAN,Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony.,18,S05E18,5
MORTY,What?,18,S05E18,5
NEWMAN,"What, do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland.",18,S05E18,5
HELEN,Jerry was necking during Schindler's List?,18,S05E18,5

MR. GOLDSTEIN,"(Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself, I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident.

ELAINE,(sighs) So how about that Aaron?,18,S05E18,5
JERRY,Whew,18,S05E18,5

ELAINE (put off by Toby's exuberance),"Yeah, really great.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, a coffee table book about coffee tables! (To Kramer) How did you come up with this idea?",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,It was there!,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' (laughs)",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE (imitating Toby),"'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from ""The Price Is Right""! (demonstrates a winner on ""The Price Is Right"")",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) ""Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.

ROBIN (to George),Maybe a clown.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,How about Bozo?,20,S05E20,5
KID,Who's Bozo?,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,George...,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,George...,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,He had a TV show! He had cartoons!,20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over for Bozo.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...",20,S05E20,5
FRANK,"Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out the damn candles!",20,S05E20,5
ESTELLE,"Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!",20,S05E20,5
FRANK,Blow out the candles!!,20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"Well, this time, you can blow out the candles.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,Hi!,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE (in a dreadful tone),"Hi, Toby.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,How are you doing today?,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen?",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,Nope.,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house.,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,Really!?,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,Maybe it'll be you!,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,Oh...well...,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion...",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE (beaming),"Well! Well, it could be you.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,No...,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"No, really.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY (standing),Really? You think so?,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE (humoring her),Sure.,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Boy, wouldn't that be exciting!",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"I mean, stranger things have happened...",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) I'd like that.,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.)",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Hey, Ronnie.",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,Hey.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?,20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,Yeah. You?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Yeah.,20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,You know Leonard Christian's here?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, I know.",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.,20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,I don't...I dunno.,20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,Is it possible for nostrils to expand?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Oh, is this a bit?",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,"Hey, I don't do ""bits."" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun.",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) I've never been to a comedy club before!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY (laughing),You are so funny!,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! (laughs)",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,What about me?,20,S05E20,5
TOBY (serious),"What about you? (laughs) I'm only kidding. You're funny, too. I love to laugh.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Good, good.",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER (to Jerry),"So, you up next?",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot.' (laughs)",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Yeah.,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...,20,S05E20,5
TOBY (loudly),"Oh, really! Really! That is so true!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.),20,S05E20,5
JERRY (attempting to carry on despite Toby's interruptions),See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel...,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, that is so true, yes!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,...that's why men hunt and women nest.,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.),20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,Hey.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Look, she didn't mean anything.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Hey! What is wrong with you?!,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,Me? Nothing's wrong with me.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you can't take it?",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Oh, I can take it.",20,S05E20,5
TOBY (to Kramer),Let's go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.),20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,"Hey, man. Good set.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Bozo?,20,S05E20,5
ERIC,No.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,B-O-Z-O?,20,S05E20,5
ERIC,"Sorry, I...",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?,20,S05E20,5
ERIC,No!,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?,20,S05E20,5
ERIC,"I don't know, I just don't.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?,20,S05E20,5
ERIC,"Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?",20,S05E20,5
ERIC,"Well, what is he?",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Yes, he's a clown!",20,S05E20,5
ERIC,"Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Alright, just forget it.",20,S05E20,5
ERIC,"Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN'S MOTHER,"Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, you seem like such a lovely young man!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"Hi Mom, how's everything?",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN'S MOTHER,"Oh, this is just a wonderful party!",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,The burgers should be ready in a minute.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE (to the EMTs),"It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric, Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.)",20,S05E20,5
ERIC,There he is! That's him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.),20,S05E20,5
ROBIN'S MOTHER,That's the coward that left us to die!,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE (voice is hoarse from screaming),I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety.,20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"But you yelled ""get out of my way""!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone behind!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?",20,S05E20,5
FIREMAN,How do you live with yourself?,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Its not easy.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,So she doesn't want to see me anymore.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"No, her too. And her mother.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Really? Her mother.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Hmm. So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,To some degree.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,In a manner of speaking.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, well, it's honest.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Perhaps.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,What's that?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) ""Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.""",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, right.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, that'd be something.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"I'm not kidding, you should do it.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Well, go ahead! Do it!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Why can't I?,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,No reason!,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,This is unprecedented!,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"There's no precedent, baby!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,What...are you using my babies now?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Well, how would you like it if I called security?",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"No, (gets up out of her chair) that's it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way.",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Boo!,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,What's happenin' here?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Hiss!,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,(going after Toby) Toby! Toby!,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,(voice; screaming) My pinky toe!,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,What did you go up there to heckle her for?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.),20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,What accident?,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,That's unbelievable!,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Wha.. you ran?,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe here, buddy - step on it.""",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Holy cow!,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - "" (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,How could you do that?!,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,You're Batman.,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,You kept makin' all the stops?,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Well, people kept ringin' the bell!",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,You did all this...for a pinky toe?,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Well, it's a valuable appendage.",20,S05E20,5
JOANNE,"So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,Really.,20,S05E20,5
JOANNE,"Yea, poor kid. What an ordeal.",20,S05E20,5
MICHAEL,And you know how extremely sensitive she is?,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,I know.,20,S05E20,5
MICHAEL,She's gonna need our full support.,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE (wearily),"Yeah, right.",20,S05E20,5
OTHER CO-WORKERS IN HALLWAY,Look who's here! Toby! (Toby enters on crutches.),20,S05E20,5
MICHAEL,"Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?",20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh no, no thank you.",20,S05E20,5
MICHAEL,Toby please let us help. We're family.,20,S05E20,5
TOBY,"Oh well, I could use some coffee.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,She got the promotion?,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE (standing in the doorway),Yep.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Why?,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Too bad.,20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,Why don't you just shut the f-,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER (from his doorway),"Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted!",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"Oh, wonderful!",20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.",20,S05E20,5
ELAINE,"Oh, of course! She's deranged.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!,20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,"How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE,"Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"Yeah, well, it won't be long.",20,S05E20,5
ANNOUNCER,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,Gotta go. (heads out on stage),20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,Robin? Robin!,20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"George, what is it? I'm working.",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,What are you talking about?,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.),20,S05E20,5
JERRY,"I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need ""the clown"" in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,"L-listen, Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.)",20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"Alright, but I'm serious about this.",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE (points his water gun at the bartender),"Alright, hand it over man!",20,S05E20,5
JERRY,...that's why men hunt and women nest.,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE (from backstage),"He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.)",20,S05E20,5
ROBIN,George! This is Ronnie Kaye!,20,S05E20,5
GEORGE,"The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?",20,S05E20,5
RONNIE (points to his nose),Nostrils.,20,S05E20,5
JERRY,George - could I have a word?,20,S05E20,5
KRAMER,"All right, get off at the next exit.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Didn't they just have a baby?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,No.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Put that on the top of your list.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,When's Rachel comin' out?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,She's makin' the three o'clock train.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,I bought him some kishka.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,What's that?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.,21,S05E21,5
JANE,Me too. I love cough medicine.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.",21,S05E21,5
JANE,What's your favorite?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?,21,S05E21,5
JANE,No.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.",21,S05E21,5
JANE,Are we almost there?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.",21,S05E21,5
JANE,What for?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.,21,S05E21,5
JANE,Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Come on, I'll rub some on yours.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.",21,S05E21,5
JANE,(No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?",21,S05E21,5
JANE,I don't think so.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,No thanks.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,No. (George leaves for the tomatoes),21,S05E21,5
JANE,"I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters with a shady hat on)",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry),21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,No lines.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,You know why? One word shade.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,What?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Jane's topless. (They all look),21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Yo yo ma.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Boutros Boutros-Ghali.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door),21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Come on, you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee!",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Oh, in a minute, Carol.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,We're gonna be right there.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,What?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)",21,S05E21,5
JANE,I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,No thanks.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,I'm good.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.",21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.",21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened and turn away)",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Ugghh.,21,S05E21,5
CAROL,Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away),21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Oh, gorgeous, yes.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,So very gorgeous.,21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Oh, you have to lie.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,It's a must lie situation.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Yes, it's a must lie situation.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"No, I don't think so.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Oooh, lobsters.",21,S05E21,5
BEN,Oh this ointment should do it.,21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician, Ben Feffa.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Hi.,21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how gorgeous?",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.,21,S05E21,5
BEN,"Elaine, you have children?",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.",21,S05E21,5
BEN,A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite breathtaking.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?,21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?",21,S05E21,5
BEN,"Uh, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby)",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, see ya.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Okay. (He leaves),21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Oh, just look at him!",21,S05E21,5
BEN,"Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his comment)",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside),21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Hey Rachel!,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,(Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to change.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,What kind of a greeting was that?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,She's got greeting problems.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,You got lobster for everybody?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"You saw who, what?",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,You saw Jane topless?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Oh you mean face down on her chest.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,No.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Face up on her back?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Yeah.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Well why'd she do that?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,I guess she was hot.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,You mean she just laid there topless?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"No, no, she got up, she walked around...",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Walked around? And you looked?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,I can't believe that you saw her before me.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again),21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Well, how good a look did you get?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Well what'd you mean?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,You can see me naked. I can offer you that.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,I've never been called breathtaking either.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,How are you gonna do that?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,I can be very clever.,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,I'm gonna take a swim.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Hey!,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Oh, sorry.",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Don't you knock?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,You might have.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,I didn't.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,You won't.,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"What'd you want anyway, George?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,We don't have any gum.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits),21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Strange man.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Wait'll you get to know him.,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"So where is this baby, anyway?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Did she do it on purpose?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,So what?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,But...,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Oh... You mean... shrinkage.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Yes. Significant shrinkage.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,So you feel you were short changed.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Well, so what's the difference?",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,What if she discusses it with Jane?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,How do you know?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Women aren't like us.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,How do women know about shrinkage?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Isn't it common knowledge?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE & JERRY,(Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters),21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Do women know about shrinkage?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"What do you mean, like laundry?",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,No.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,It shrinks?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Like a frightened turtle!,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,Why does it shrink?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,It just does.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.,21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,"Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,You mean you've never tasted lobster?,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,No.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.",21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE & JERRY,No!,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.",21,S05E21,5
CAROL,I'm gonna get him.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?",21,S05E21,5
JANE,"It's nothing, George.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?",21,S05E21,5
JANE,What is it with you?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,(To George) Easy big fella.,21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,"So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the Fleesher's Market?",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"No, I got 'em in the ocean.",21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,The ocean? What'd you mean?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.",21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those lobsters from there. That's against the law.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.,21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table),21,S05E21,5
CAROL,(Entering with baby) Here he is.,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby),21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Some night, huh?",21,S05E21,5
BEN,"Yeah, I wish I had my telescope.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Some dinner, huh?",21,S05E21,5
BEN,Nothing like fresh caught lobster.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Some house, huh?",21,S05E21,5
BEN,It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Some ugly baby, huh?",21,S05E21,5
BEN,What did you say?,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.",21,S05E21,5
BEN,He is something.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.",21,S05E21,5
BEN,"Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby)",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,You told her?,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Yeah, what's the big deal?",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,You're going back to New York now?,21,S05E21,5
JANE,"Yeah, I have some things to do.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.",21,S05E21,5
JANE,So what if I did?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?,21,S05E21,5
JANE,I don't know what you're talking about.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!",21,S05E21,5
JANE,(patronizing George) I'm sure it is.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,You looking for this? (Holding up lobster),21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Oh, Kramer! You startled me.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Well, I thought you might wind up around here.",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an' well I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Why not?,21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Well, that wouldn't be kosher.",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,"Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Come on, Kramer.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Heyahhh!,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,I just heard a car drive out. What was that?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)",21,S05E21,5
CAROL,"George, thanks so much for making breakfast.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Ya I didn't know you could cook.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.",21,S05E21,5
BEN,"Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (hearing this Elaine looks at him extremely annoyed)",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Good morning.,21,S05E21,5
ALL,"Hey, hey. Morning",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, you really saved me.",21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,What happened?,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.,21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"You're right, I would have.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.",21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,A little breakfast.,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,Yeah.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,"Yes, I do. Thank you.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Umm... This is so good.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Ah, enjoying them?",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Mm-hmm.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,There's lobster in these eggs?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Well, I guess I gotta go, too.",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)",21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,Excuse me?,21,S05E21,5
POLICE,"I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps.",21,S05E21,5
KRAMER,Wonder what's goin' on.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.",21,S05E21,5
MICHAEL,"There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer waves to policeman)",21,S05E21,5
RACHEL,Ahh! Don't you ever knock?,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,"Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.,21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?,21,S05E21,5
JERRY,They got some sort of program.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,"Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.",21,S05E21,5
JERRY,"Hey, isn't that Michael's car?",21,S05E21,5
ELAINE,There's Rachel.,21,S05E21,5
GEORGE,Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato),21,S05E21,5
MR. LIPPMAN,To your promotion.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"Well, you're really on your way now.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,You really oughtta do something about that cold.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,You got a raise?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Oh, when did that happen?",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,They're signing the papers next week.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" Brown would be very proud of you.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks),22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Oh, the beach.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,What is it that isn't working?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.",22,S05E22,5
WAITRESS ,"Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,(annoyed) Good for the tuna.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,So what? What am I supposed to do?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Go talk to her.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.",22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,"Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch as me.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.,22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,I'm Victoria. Hi.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,What's happening?,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Oh yeah, I heard all about it.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Oh, you better believe it!",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,I'll loan you my puffy shirt.,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"No, no, no.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,What're you gonna talk about?,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Well, coffee tables.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,You know who you are? Even Steven,22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,Are you growing a beard?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Why shave every day? It just grows right back.,22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,I guess ...,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.",22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,"Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.,22,S05E22,5
MAN #1 ,"Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?",22,S05E22,5
MAN #2 ,"Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!",22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,What are we gonna do? Should we just move?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,That won't be necessary.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!",22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,"Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only nine thirty.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.,22,S05E22,5
VICTORIA,"Who are you, George Costanza?",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.,22,S05E22,5
THEATER MANAGER,"Excuse me, is your name Elaine?",22,S05E22,5

THEATER MANAGER,Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?,22,S05E22,5

THEATER MANAGER,"Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,(gasp) An accident? What happened?,22,S05E22,5
THEATER MANAGER,"Well-he got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. He's in St.Vincent Hospital, room 907.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Oh. Ok. Thank you.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?,22,S05E22,5
COUNTERPERSON,(handing the Jujyfruits to Elaine) There you go.,22,S05E22,5
JAKE,"So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,You want one?,22,S05E22,5
JAKE,No thanks.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?,22,S05E22,5
JAKE,Where did you get those?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,At the movies.,22,S05E22,5
JAKE,Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you went in?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, he did.",22,S05E22,5
JAKE,Then when did you get those?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Right after ... that ...,22,S05E22,5
JAKE,"So you heard that I was in a car accident, and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit?",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Well... the counter...was right there, and...",22,S05E22,5
JAKE,"I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect on you.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"No, no, it does!",22,S05E22,5
JAKE,"(angry) If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruit!",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,But...Jake...,22,S05E22,5
JAKE,"I would like to be alone now, please.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"But, Jake, I didn't...",22,S05E22,5
JAKE,Goodnight!,22,S05E22,5
POKER PLAYER #1,"Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?",22,S05E22,5
POKER PLAYER #2,"Good idea, I'm kinda tired.",22,S05E22,5
POKER PLAYER #3,How'd you do?,22,S05E22,5

REGIS,Can I bring out our next guest now?,22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,"Please, please.",22,S05E22,5
REGIS,"Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, and this is the best part -",22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,I love this.,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,It's a coffee table book about coffee tables! (holds the book up for the audience),22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?,22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,I did.,22,S05E22,5

REGIS,"(shaking Kramer's hand) Hello, Kramer is here.",22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,"I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!",22,S05E22,5
REGIS,"Ah, well, yes Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea?",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.",22,S05E22,5
REGIS,"You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill myself, you're writing books!",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!",22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,"Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, really, I-I love coffee tables, and I-I thought I was the only one.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.",22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,Is that fabulous?,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,Look at this!,22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,Is that fabulous?,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,Fabulous!,22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,I want one of these.,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?,22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables.,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,That's true. That's right.,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,"Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)",22,S05E22,5
REGIS,"I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!",22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,But he's adorable.,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,"Ya he is, he's a nice looking guy.",22,S05E22,5
KATHY LEE,It's all over my dress.,22,S05E22,5
REGIS,We'll be right back in a moment.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,So it's all over?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, it got pretty nasty.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Why didn't you eat it in the cab?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,What's all this?,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Played cards last night.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Oh yeah? How'd you do?,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Broke even.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,You always break even.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Do you have twenty bucks?,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,What for?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Just gimme twenty bucks.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,(shocked) What the hell was that?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Bad.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Day was -,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Night.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Yes!,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,So you just did the opposite of everything?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Elaine ... look! A twenty!,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,Hey boss.,22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,Kramer. Come in.,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"Uh, Ya, Have a seat.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Woah, that's quite a honk!",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"Ya, thank you.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.,22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"The reason I asked you in here, is I-I caught your appearance on uh ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and -",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Ya that was pretty good, huh?",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"An-Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didn't do any more of these shows.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,Because of the coffee thing?,22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"Kramer, I'm sorry.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling ""Sonia Live""?",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,It's out -,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"Kra-Kramer, I -",22,S05E22,5
MR. CUSHMAN,Why don't you tell me about some of your previous work experience?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.,22,S05E22,5
MR. CUSHMAN,Go on.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.",22,S05E22,5
MR. CUSHMAN,Do you talk to everybody like this?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Of course.,22,S05E22,5
MR. CUSHMAN,My niece told me you were different.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"I am different, yeah.",22,S05E22,5
MR. CUSHMAN,"I gotta tell ya, you are the complete opposite of every applicant we've seen. (gets out of his chair) Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd like you to meet. (George gets up and goes over) This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.",22,S05E22,5
MR. STEINBRENNER,Nice to meet you.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!",22,S05E22,5
MR. STEINBRENNER,Hire this man!,22,S05E22,5
SECRETARY,Tina Robbins is here to see you.,22,S05E22,5
MAN,Who's that?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.",22,S05E22,5
MAN,"Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.",22,S05E22,5
TINA,Please.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Hi Tina.,22,S05E22,5
TINA,Hi Elaine.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"So, I haven't seen you in a while.",22,S05E22,5
TINA,"Elaine, we have a problem.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Well, what is it?",22,S05E22,5
TINA,You're getting kicked out.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Kicked out?! Why?!,22,S05E22,5
TINA,"Well, there's been a number of complaints.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Yeah? Like what?,22,S05E22,5
TINA,"Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Ah, I didn't know who he was!",22,S05E22,5
TINA,That's why there's a buzzer.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,What else?,22,S05E22,5
TINA,"Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,What else have you got?,22,S05E22,5
TINA,"Well, let's see. (Takes out a list from her bag)",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.",22,S05E22,5
RACHEL,I suppose...,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.",22,S05E22,5
RACHEL,(sighs) Jerry ...,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Yes?,22,S05E22,5
RACHEL,I've been doing a lot of thinking.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Uh huh?,22,S05E22,5
RACHEL,"Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.",22,S05E22,5

RACHEL,"Yeah, you too.",22,S05E22,5

JERRY,I can't believe it.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Ya!,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Ya?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,(on buzzer) It's me.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,That's a great place!,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"I'm back in business, baby!",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Hi Elaine.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Hi.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,How're things going?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Why? Why are they doing that?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,I don't know! They have a list of grievances.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,The jewel thief?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Yeah, the jewel thief.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,What else?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,Instinct.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead),22,S05E22,5
JERRY,"Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?",22,S05E22,5
SECRETARY,"Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here.",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"Oh ya alright... tell them I'll be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaine's desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well, this is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the street. Boy, they sure saved us.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,"(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.",22,S05E22,5
CHAIRMAN,(noticing Mr. Lippman in the hallway) Ah Lippman son. (Lippman smiles and is forced to enter his office) Lippman son. (speaks some Japanese),22,S05E22,5
INTERPRETER,"Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company.",22,S05E22,5
MR. LIPPMAN,"I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. It's germs.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Is that the end of it?,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Yeah, it's the last one.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Alright.,22,S05E22,5
ESTELLE,"I can't believe you're moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer, is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Oh, it's true.",22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Alright, let's go.",22,S05E22,5
FRANK,Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps George's forehead),22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.,22,S05E22,5
ESTELLE,"Jerry, did you hear this?",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,He knows what he's doing.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Opposite.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Why'd you have to eat so many?,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.,22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.,22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Don't say that.,22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,It's true. I'm George! I'm George!,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.",22,S05E22,5
ELAINE,Uh huh.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.",22,S05E22,5
KRAMER,"Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.",22,S05E22,5
JERRY,Ah ... let's call it even.,22,S05E22,5
GEORGE,"O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.",1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL,Really?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!",1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL (wiping sweat from his brow),"Alright, alright.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,What are all sweatin' for?,1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL,It's hot in this uniform.,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?,1,S06E01,6
TARTBULL,What is what?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"This uniform, what's it made from?",1,S06E01,6
TARTBULL,"I don't know, cotton?",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!",1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL,So?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.,1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL,"Well, this is what they give us.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?,1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL,You really think cotton's better?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.",1,S06E01,6
TARTABULL,"Yeah, good idea. Catch ya later. (Leaves.)",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)",1,S06E01,6
HOT DOG VENDOR,Hot dogs here! Yankee franks!,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Oh, you want one?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Yeah.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.),1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"That's alright, I got it.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Jerry!,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Elaine, stop it.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I'm sorry.,1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM,"Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. (The three contestants make their way to their seats, right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.)",1,S06E01,6
JERRY (to Elaine),"Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, she was an editor.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Right, just like you.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.),1,S06E01,6
CROWD,Hey! Down in front! (Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.),1,S06E01,6
JERRY (offers a hot dog to Miss Rhode Island),Hot dog?,1,S06E01,6
MISS RHODE ISLAND,"No, thanks. I'm watching my weight.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...",1,S06E01,6
MISS RHODE ISLAND,Rhode Island.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.),1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,You're incredible.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Chaperone? What, are you kidding?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"No, it's part of the contest rules.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,What does the chaperone do?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"I don't know, she just sits there.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Can she talk?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.),1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,You're calling her?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Of course, they're polyester.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Why do they wear polyester?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,I don't know. That's all gonna change.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,You're going to do something about it?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Why shouldn't I?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY (doubtfully),No reason...,1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,"Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (gushing),Yes! Grace!,1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,Not many people have grace.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,"You can't have ""a little grace."" You either have grace, or you...don't.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"O.K., fine, I have...no grace.",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,And you can't acquire grace.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace.",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (fed up),"Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,Thank you for coming in.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, right.",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,"We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (stands up),"I have no chance, do I?",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,No. (They shake hands.),1,S06E01,6
LANDIS'S INTERCOM,Justin Pitt to see you.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Justin Pitt?,1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce.",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,Excuse me?,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.),1,S06E01,6
PITT,"Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department or not.",1,S06E01,6
LANDIS,"Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. (Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.)",1,S06E01,6
PITT (clearly affected by Elaine's appearance),Charmed.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Nothin.',1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,What state?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Rhode Island.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,They're never in contention.,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,How do you know?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Giddy-up!,1,S06E01,6
JERRY (to Karen),I think I got someone!,1,S06E01,6
PITT (looking at Elaine and smiling),"The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine, sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.",1,S06E01,6
PITT,"No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Grace?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,"Grace, yes.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,You think Ihave grace?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,"Some grace, yes.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Just some?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,"Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (laughing),"Oh, Mr. Pitt.",1,S06E01,6
PITT,"Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right away.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?",1,S06E01,6
SHOWALTER,"Sure, George.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,1,S06E01,6
SHOWALTER,"Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.",1,S06E01,6
SHOWALTER,How so?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.",1,S06E01,6
SHOWALTER,"Cotton, huh?",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.",1,S06E01,6
SHOWALTER,"You may have something there, George.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Oh - I've got something.,1,S06E01,6
SHOWALTER (considering),Hmm. Cotton uniforms.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Congratulations!,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Now, what is it that you do, exactly?",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,I attend to his personal affairs.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Like what?,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Really! Socks!,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER (shows Jerry his outfit),"So, what do you think? Does this work?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you know what I mean.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,No way!,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,What?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"I'm not going to ""defile"" her!",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,But -,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER (holds up his hand),AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,But wait a minute...,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed the whole world!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER (to Karen),What advice would you give young people?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Alright, Kramer!",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"You really know a lot about this, don't you?",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"Well, what could she have done?",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.),1,S06E01,6
KAREN,What else?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Hey, come on!",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,Really.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.),1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"So, what's your talent?",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,Magic.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,Six.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"No, five. But you were close.",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #1,And the Yankees take the field!,1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #2,"Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different tonight? I can't put my finger on it...",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #1,"Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton uniforms.",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #2,"They seem blousier, softer...",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #1,"Well, it is a natural fibre...",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,How's your evening?,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"Well, I'm wearing this red dress -",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Stop right there.,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,No good?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Disaster.,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,Why?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karen's hotel.),1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Well, here we are...",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant?",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh, good night, Jerry. (They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out, leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.)",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Hey.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Oh, come on.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"And that waist cincher, that was the topper!",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Oh, you're poo-pooing!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Yes, I poo-poo.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I don't want to stop her!,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Well, did you see it?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,See what?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) ""Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' """,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Boy, they really do sound comfortable.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE (noticing Jerry's suitcase),"Hey, where ya goin'?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I'm working in Atlantic City.,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Really!,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"So, what do you think?",1,S06E01,6
PITT (pulling up the socks),No.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,You don't like them?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,"No, I don't like them.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,What's wrong?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,They're too tight.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Too tight?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,"There's no elastic, you need to pull too much (pulls them up more).",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (examining the socks),I think they look good!,1,S06E01,6
PITT,They're cutting off the circulation.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)",1,S06E01,6
PITT,Hello?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?",1,S06E01,6
PITT (hands the phone to Elaine),It's for you.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Sorry. Hello?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Hey Elaine, it's me.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Jerry?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,We're going to Atlantic City.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Really? When?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Today, right now! Are you in?",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?",1,S06E01,6
PITT,Tomorrow?,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Yes.,1,S06E01,6
PITT,But I was hoping for my new socks today!,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,"Well, it's just one more day.",1,S06E01,6
PITT,I'm sorry. I must have them today.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (to Jerry),I can't go.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Why not?,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.,1,S06E01,6
PITT,Elaine!,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,I gotta go. (Hangs up.),1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"Yes, I see. O.K.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"Kramer, are these questions really that important...?",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Hey.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Hey.,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,How was the show?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Good. How was the roulette?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!",1,S06E01,6
PITT,"It's good, but...",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,But what??,1,S06E01,6
PITT,Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up.,1,S06E01,6
ELAINE (pulling up Pitt's socks),"No, no! They'll stay up!",1,S06E01,6
PITT,"For a while, yes, but not in the long run.",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.),1,S06E01,6
PITT,"Oh, forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those?",1,S06E01,6
ELAINE,What do you want!?,1,S06E01,6
PITT,"I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,What the hell is that?,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY (getting out of bed),"Well, I can't sleep with that noise.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Good night, Stan.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,What is it?,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,How did this happen?,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water!",1,S06E01,6
"KRAMER (goes out on the terrace to look, and slips in the water)","Well, how did this happen?",1,S06E01,6
KAREN,It must have been an accident.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,What? Why? What happened?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Her birds are dead.,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,Birds?,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER (comes back inside with his finger pointed at Jerry),"You killed them, didn't you?",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,"Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE (comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth),What was that all about?,1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.",1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.),1,S06E01,6
KAREN,"O.K., this is it!",1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,How ya feelin'?,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,I'm a little nervous!,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,There's nothing to be nervous about.,1,S06E01,6
KAREN,But I've never sung before in my life!,1,S06E01,6
PHILBIN,"And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,I heard those doves were really incredible.,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.),1,S06E01,6
JERRY,It's like watching an animal get tortured.,1,S06E01,6
GEORGE,"Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,"Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #1,And the Yankees take the field!,1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #2,"What is with the Yankees? They look like they're having trouble running, they can't move!",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #1,"It's their uniforms, they're too tight, they've shrunk! They're running like penguins! Forget this game!",1,S06E01,6
ANNOUNCER #2,"Oh my God, Mattingly just split his pants!",1,S06E01,6
JERRY,That's a shame.,1,S06E01,6
KRAMER,Poise. Poise!,1,S06E01,6
STATIONER,May I help you?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,"Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"No, I'm sure you do.",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,They're pretty expensive.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Well, it's for my boss.",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,What do you do?,2,S06E02,6
Ex,Whatever.,2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,"Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Elaine.,2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,"Elaine, . . . and your last name?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,And your number?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Uh, aw, KL5-239O.",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . .",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Why did you give him MY number?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,I think he's got ideas.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Hey, hey.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Hey hey,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,Hi Jerry.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Hi Julie.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Elaine, Julie.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Hi.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,Hi.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Oh, mine's ""Ike"".",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Hey, wanna get some lunch?",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Just had a big bowl of Kix.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Ah, no.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Please come, Elaine.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"No, no. How about if you bring me back something?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Sure, all right, what do you want?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,They have big salads.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,I've never seen a big salad.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,They have a big salad.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"It's okay, you don't",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"(???), we'll see you in a little while.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Maybe I should just get married.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,You can say that again.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Good for you.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Right on baby. (???),2,S06E02,6
JERRY,What was that?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Who Gendason?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,Steve Gendason.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Why is that name familiar?,2,S06E02,6
Hx,He used to be a baseball player.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,So what?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Certainly are.,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,All right. You're in MY face.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,I still don't see what the big deal is.,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,I like Anna Quindlen's column and Safire. Don't you like Safire?,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Oh, Safire. Uh ha",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,Although at times can be rather pedantic.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"No, no. I'd like to take you out.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Okay, thanks, George.",2,S06E02,6
Wx,Here's your big salad to go.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Oh, thank you.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,I told ya'. He has ideas.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,He doesn't even care if a man answers.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Or you.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Hey, hey.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Hey.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,Sorry e're late.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,No problem.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,Here's your big salad.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Thank you, Julie.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Sure, George.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Ya, you go.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Bye bye,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,Did you see what just happened?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Well, that all depends. . .",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Yeah, so?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Is that a fact?,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,No it isn't.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,I mean I'm the one who bought it.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Yes you did.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,You think she should have said something?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,She could have.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Oh, I know.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Obviously.,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,Turn on the TV.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,What?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,I'm puttin it on,2,S06E02,6
TV,". . . the district attorney's office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something we'll just have to wait.",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,Jerry . . .,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Well, it has nothing to do with you.",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,I like Julie. She's very personable.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, she's very lovely.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,That's great George.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,So did you enjoy your lunch?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Even though what?,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,". . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"What? What are you trying to say, George?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"You want the money for the big salad, George?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"No, no,",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,What is the problem?,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,"Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go out.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Ah, no , I don't think so.",2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Why not?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Who is staring?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Hello Newman.,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,"Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, no I don't. Why?",2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,"You know, Genderson. This is something big.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,I suppose.,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,What did Kramer say?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,I don't know. Nothing.?,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,"Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates . . . Margaret?",2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Hello.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,You two know each other?,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,You might say that.,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,We used to go out.,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,"Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Just a few times.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Why?,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,I liked him.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"You liked, Newman?",2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.",2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,He ended it.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,. . . HE ended it?,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, no of course not.",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,What tee?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Newman! She went out with Newman!,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,It must be a mistake.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, there's less.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,It's possible.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.",2,S06E02,6
Wx,Would you like some more coffee?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No,, but thank you.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Ugh! You are kidding me.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,To please Mr. Pitt.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Uh, great!",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Hi Julie.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Hi.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Hi Julie.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,How do you know THAT?,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,Who is it.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,It's Jerry.,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?",2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?",2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what Happened. She wasn't my type.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Noit your type?,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,Not really.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Well, how come?",2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,"Ah, she just didn't do it for me.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"What, what is wrong with her?",2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,"Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,You don't think she's attractive?,2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,"No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.",2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,Care for some lemonade?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, thank you.",2,S06E02,6
NEWMAN,"Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,What are you so worried about this for?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,He did?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,So it had nothing to do with you.,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"No, I don't think so.",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Oh, I love curls.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Yeah,, me too.",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you later.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Where you going?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,Genderson's.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,You're going to see Genderson?,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,It's weighing on my conscience.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,A ha! We're just friends.,2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Oh, share.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"Well, she probably just assumed.",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"Um, did she?",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,". . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,That's what I'm suggesting.,2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,". . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?",2,S06E02,6
JULIE,"George, all I did was hand someone a bag.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.,2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,"Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Really? A fight with the foreman?,2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,Yes.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.",2,S06E02,6
STATIONER,"Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight?",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,Okay.,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,You had how many dates with him? Three?,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Around three. I don't know.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,And . .,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung up on him. What are you looking at?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,What? I'm not looking. Nothing.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Why are you looking at my face?,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Where am I going to look?,2,S06E02,6
MARGARET,Kiss me.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,. . . I can't.,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,Newman!,2,S06E02,6
JERRY,All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,You're going out with the stationery store guy?,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.,2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,"Uh, uh.",2,S06E02,6
GEORGE,"You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.",2,S06E02,6
JERRY,"Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.",2,S06E02,6
TV,"As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing buddies.",2,S06E02,6
POLICE,9-1-1 What are you reporting,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.",2,S06E02,6
POLICE,"Okay, sir, and what's your name?",2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!,2,S06E02,6
Genderson,I told you not to take the turnpike.,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,I thought we would blend in.,2,S06E02,6
Genderson,If we took the palisades this never have happened.,2,S06E02,6
KRAMER,we would have had all that bridge traffic.,2,S06E02,6
Genderson,"Ah, just drive.",2,S06E02,6
ELAINE,She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Your friend, Noreen.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"If you don't believe me, ask her.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Check the pile.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,I don't know.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Open it, it's from Hallmark.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Oh.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Hello, darling.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,Let me see.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Who's Kristin?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,Did you ask her about me?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, go ahead.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,You sure you don't mind?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.,3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,Hello?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.",3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,Jerry?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Jerry Seinfeld.,3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,"Oh, I like Jerry a lot.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,You mean like like?,3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,What are you talking about?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Noreen, were you hitting on him?",3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,"Noreen's not here, this is Dan.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Ooh.,3,S06E03,6
DAN,You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Uh oh.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"So was I right? She likes me, right?",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?",3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Is this Noreen?,3,S06E03,6
HIGH PITCHED VOICE,(Noreen) What would ever possess you to make up a story like that.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Noreen, are you crying?",3,S06E03,6
DAN,"No, this is Dan!",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Oh, hi Dan.",3,S06E03,6
MR. PITT,Elaine? Work?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.,3,S06E03,6
MR. PITT,Who was crying?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.",3,S06E03,6
MR. PITT,"(unwrapping a candy bar, placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) I'm sure it won't, but someone was crying and I want to know who it was.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.",3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,"Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, I know you are.",3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,You got the card I sent?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,I did.,3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,So where is it?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,What?,3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,The card. Is this it in the trash?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,No?,3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,"This is my card, you threw it away.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Well--,3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,I put a lot of thought into this card.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.",3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,Fine. I gotta get back to the office.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?",3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,You have no sentimentality.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.",3,S06E03,6
KRISTIN,"Oh, so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great!",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"New cards, huh?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"No, they're old cards from my grandmother.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"(opening a card) Oh, a check.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"I don't know, it's ten dollars.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,But you got a whole pile here. 1987?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Oh so what.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, get out of here.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,The rule is a minimum of two days.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,I'm making it up.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Absolutely.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Let's have it.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,You want me to ask one of the Yankees.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Could you?,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Alright. I'll run it by a few people.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Yes, she's very upset.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Who was flirting with you?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,She wasn't flirting with you.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Really?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Why does he do that?,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, you know.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?",3,S06E03,6
WAITRESS,That's the extra toast. Get it?,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,What?,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"So, what do you think?",3,S06E03,6
MR. MORGAN,"A PBS fundraiser? I'm not gonna waste any of the players' time with that, besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.",3,S06E03,6
MR. MORGAN,"Uh, what the hell are you doing?",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?",3,S06E03,6
MR. MORGAN,"You know, maybe George has something here about PBS.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,Huh? Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
NANA,Hello?,3,S06E03,6
VOICE,"Hello, this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn.",3,S06E03,6
NANA,Chemical Bank? I haven't used that account in months.,3,S06E03,6
VOICE,"Well, someone's been cashing the checks and you're overdrawn.",3,S06E03,6
NANA,Oh dear. I'll be down there first thing in the morning.,3,S06E03,6
VOICE,"(unheard by Nana as she hangs up the phone) Wait, we can do this over the phone.",3,S06E03,6
"(Fade to the next morning, the alarm clock goes off, it's 5","30, Nana turns off the alarm, fully dressed, gathers her coat and purse, sighs, and heads for the door.)",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,You got Danny Tartabull?!,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Excuse me?,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm Yankee management.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,You're just answering phones!,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,It would put me at ease.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men",3,S06E03,6
WAITRESS,"Oh, you're getting it (pointing to menu with index finger), it comes with your breakfast special.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Right you are.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.",3,S06E03,6
WAITRESS,(scratching cheek with middle finger) I'll check.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,"(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, she had an itch.",3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.",3,S06E03,6
STREET TOUGH,"Looking for something, lady?",3,S06E03,6
NANA,Isn't the Chemical Bank on this block?,3,S06E03,6
STREET TOUGH,The bank? It burned. It's gone!,3,S06E03,6
NANA,Oh dear.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,(answering) Hello?,3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,Jerry? Hello.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Uncle Leo!,3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,"Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Nana's missing?,3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,"I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, that's right. You did.",3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,What kind of checks?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,I think Chemical Bank.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Oh, they were Chemical.",3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Hey, I didn't twist your arm.",3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,"Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Well, don't look at me.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,It's your fault!,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.,3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,"So anyway, it's caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry, he won't let up.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.",3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,"No, why?",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Well, you know, because he's a high talker.",3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,"He does raise his voice occasionally, but that's normal.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.",3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,Really?,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?,3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,I never noticed that.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?",3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,Great. I'm going out with a man who sounds like a woman.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"Well, he looks like a man.",3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.,3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,I guess.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,I know he belches a lot.,3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,"Well, that's something. So, Jerry thought I was flirting with him.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Yeah.,3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,"(cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork) Hm. He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,What are you doing?,3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,I'm eating this cookie.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just",3,S06E03,6
NOREEN,"No, I've seen people do it. I like it.",3,S06E03,6
DANNY TARTABULL,"This isn't gonna take long, is it?",3,S06E03,6

DANNY TARTABULL,I'm sure it's fine.,3,S06E03,6
GEORGE,(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!,3,S06E03,6

Banker,"I'm sorry, the account had insufficient funds. We had to return the",3,S06E03,6
Nana,"Oh dear, that's my grandson. May I call him now and explain?",3,S06E03,6
Banker,"Oh, certainly.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Would you?,3,S06E03,6
Elaine (answering),Hello?,3,S06E03,6
Nana,"Hello, I need to speak to Jerry.",3,S06E03,6
Elaine (thinking it's Dan),"Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.",3,S06E03,6

ELAINE,"Um, what does Nana sound like?",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Like a grandmother, why?",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Well...,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,"I don't know, maybe.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,You told Nana to drop dead?!,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,It's possible.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Yes, it is!",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.",3,S06E03,6

JERRY,"No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.",3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,Please-,3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,I want-,3,S06E03,6

KRAMER,"Jerry, I'll take care of it.",3,S06E03,6
DAN,Is Jerry in there?,3,S06E03,6

DAN,What?,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco.

MAN,I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,(answering) PBS pledge drive.,3,S06E03,6
NANA,"Hello, I'd like to speak with Jerry.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.",3,S06E03,6
NANA,This is his grandmother.,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.",3,S06E03,6
NANA,"Tell Jerry I'm sorry, I'm going to have to write him some new checks.",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'",3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,My Nana?,3,S06E03,6
KRAMER,"And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!",3,S06E03,6
UNCLE LEO,"She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!",3,S06E03,6
JERRY,I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.,3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Yes, he is.",3,S06E03,6

WAITRESS,(at the next table) Here's your knife and fork.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,I just don't get it.,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,What is wrong with everybody?,3,S06E03,6
JERRY,"(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!",3,S06E03,6
ELAINE,(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!,3,S06E03,6
"I think the thing I admire most about the Chinese is that they're hanging in there with the chopsticks. Because, if you think about it, you know, they've seen the fork... by now. I'm sure they've seen the spoon, they're going, ""Yeah, yeah, they're OK... We're going to stay with the sticks."" I mean, I don't know how they've missed it","thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up, has his breakfast with the chopsticks, goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel... Hello?... Shovel! Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,(feeling face) Good shave today...,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...,4,S06E04,6

JERRY,"(pause) Yeah, I guess.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,...So how's Noreen?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,A Long Talker.,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,(pause) All right; let's move it out.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Hey, isn't that George's father?",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,That man he's with is he wearing a cape?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I believe he is wearing a cape.,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine),4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,That sounds urgent...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Donna Chang?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Isn't that a little racist?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,So listen...,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,He's on with a Chinese woman.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,You got a comfort problem there?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,I thought you wore silk underwear.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,A lot!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I got a date!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,With the Chinese woman?!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"No, why should I? I wear boxers.",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,You ever get a woman pregnant?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,She suggested it!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,She's very assimilated.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Paul again?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,...Huh?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,You didn't ask him?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,(suspicious) You didn't say hello?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Why was he wearing a cape?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Was my father wearing a cape?,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,No. Jacket and tie no cape.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)",4,S06E04,6

KRAMER,"All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.",4,S06E04,6
DOCTOR,First thing you should wear boxer shorts.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,All the time?,4,S06E04,6
DOCTOR,All the time. Ya have to get off Jockeys right away.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so...

DONNA,I mean I'm Donna Chang.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,(pause) You're Donna Chang?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,Did you think I was Chinese?...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Oh. No. What, you mean because of the ""Chang""?",4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I didn't think so.,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Used to be ""Changstein.""",4,S06E04,6

ELAINE,"(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as ""Donna Chang""...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,So then why are you seeing her again...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Well, she is a woman.",4,S06E04,6

JERRY,"Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Here, take my Jockey shorts.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Whoa! Whoa!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Here, what is that?!!",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Wha--you have a low sperm count?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear),4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Look! I don't want 'em!,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves),4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.",4,S06E04,6
FRANK,Ya know what I like about Manhattan? There's no mosquitoes.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Plenty of mosquitoes.,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,Queens is full of mosquitoes.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"So, Dad...",4,S06E04,6
FRANK,"Gnats, too. If I'm not mistaken.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,(angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?!,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Jerry and Elaine saw you.,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,They didn't say hello?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Well, they were in a rush.",4,S06E04,6
FRANK,"They couldn't just say hello?!... Oh, to hell with them.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...",4,S06E04,6
FRANK,"Elaine, I can see, not sayin' hello. She's very--what's the word--uh, supercilious.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"So Dad,--",4,S06E04,6
FRANK,(shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Did they uncross the lines yet?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"No, they can't find the problem. It's really getting ridicurous.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"(long pause -- did he hear ""ridicurous"" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, ""ridicurous""?",4,S06E04,6
DONNA,Ridiculous.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"(pause) I thought you said... ""ridicurous."" (Donna looks puzzled)",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Hey-- (spots Donna),4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Oh, what are you doing here?",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.",4,S06E04,6
DONNA,Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) I'm Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,You spoke to my mother?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"She was trying to call you, but--",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,The rines are crossed?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Did you say, ""The rines are crossed?""",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Did I?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"(pause) George, she's so sweet. We talked for an hour!",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,(smile) Yeah.,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Anyway, I'm really sorry.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Gee, I never thought of that.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Have you ever spent any time with these people...?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,You know what this has to do with?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,What?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,All right Superman's the exception.,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,You went back to the Jockeys?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Wrong again.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"(pause as he realizes) Oh, no.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,What? What?...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Don't you need a little... help?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...,4,S06E04,6
NOREEN,"Yeah, well... We're trying... But he just went insane there for a while...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Oh, he went insane?...",4,S06E04,6
NOREEN,"Believe it or not, Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!",4,S06E04,6
NOREEN,(has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement) I can't believe that was you...,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...",4,S06E04,6
NOREEN,(reconsidering Paul's worth) ...So you thought he was boring?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(head in arms) I know--,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Yeah.,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,It's Donna Chang.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little),4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(like a little girl) Okay...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,She was lost...,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!",4,S06E04,6
DONNA,Hi.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...",4,S06E04,6
(At the same time--DONNA,Helllo...--ELAINE Hi! How are you?),4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"(to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me, they're not getting divorced.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(happy gasp) Oh.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Why? What happened?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Well, she was trying to call George last night, she got me, we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Wow! That's amazing!,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Anyway, she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner!",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(off camera) Huh.,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,She said you should come too.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Tonight?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,"Yeah--I just remembered, I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone)",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!",4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,(calmly) We're not getting divorced.,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand),4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.",4,S06E04,6
FRANK,"Yeah, we worked it out.",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,He was my lawyer.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Your lawyer wears a cape...?,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,Yeah. So what?,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,Who wears a cape?,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,He's very independent; he doesn't follow the trends.,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,He looks ridiculous in that thing...,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,(shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!!,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,(shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?!,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,All right! Come on! Let's not fight.,4,S06E04,6
Frank and ESTELLE,All right! All right!,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,Georgie's right. (pats him on the cheek),4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,It was that Chinese woman.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Confucius, huh?",4,S06E04,6
DONNA,Yeah.,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"(pause) You know, you're not Chinese...",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Hey! I heard the good news!,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,"Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Elaine was... in a rush.,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,"(to George, pointing) I knew it was Elaine!!",4,S06E04,6
DONNA,You must be Estelle.,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,(giggles) Yes. Who are you...?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,I'm Donna Chang!,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,"(steps back, appalled) You're not Chinese!",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Y'ello?,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Paul?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Elaine!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Kramer?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,(pause) YEAHH!,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,What are you doin' there?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Wellll, isn't it obvious?",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Yes she is...,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,YOU feel?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"What, are you insane?!",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...,4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!,4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"Can't help ya, kid.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down),4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,You're not Chinese!?!?,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,...No.,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,I thought you were Chinese!!,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,I'm from Long Island.,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin' advice from a Chinese woman!!,4,S06E04,6
DONNA,I'm sorry...?,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,Well... then... that changes everything!,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,What?!,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,She's not Chinese; I was duped!!,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!,4,S06E04,6
ESTELLE,I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room),4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!,4,S06E04,6
FRANK,(shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!!,4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine),4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.",4,S06E04,6
ELAINE,"(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...",4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"Oh, it had to happen!!",4,S06E04,6
JERRY,Hey.,4,S06E04,6
GEORGE,"I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played ""Clue""! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]",4,S06E04,6
KRAMER,"(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)",4,S06E04,6
NOREEN,(surprised) Who are you?!,4,S06E04,6
MAN,I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety),4,S06E04,6
JERRY,"So, she got you to join a book club?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Nah, I don't like that one.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"So, what's your first book?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"It's kinda old, isn't it?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY (standing),"Oh, sure...Truman Capote.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,He's a great writer.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh, yeah.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Did you ever read anything by him?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,No. You?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Nah.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY (sees a white couch by the wall),"Oh, what about this one? Look at this, this is it! This is what I'm looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh, yeah!",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Hey, what's going on?",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"New couch, baby!",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,New couch? Why?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.",5,S06E05,6
"ELAINE (to Carl, flirtatiously)",Hello.,5,S06E05,6
CARL,Hello.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,What are you doing with your old couch?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I'll take it.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,Hey! Couch is comin.',5,S06E05,6
JERRY,It's here!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY (nonplussed),Yeah. So do I.,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,Ooh! Remember Poppie?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Yeah.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,What was that again?,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (in a southern accent),"Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,What made you resurrect that old idea?,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the ""old"" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh, Kramer, I -",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.",5,S06E05,6
CARL (hands Jerry an invoice),Sign here.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (to Carl),"Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.",5,S06E05,6
CARL,Sure.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?",5,S06E05,6
CARL,"Yeah, I think we can squeeze you in.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,Did you offer those guys a drink?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Uh, no. Should I have?",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,What kind of a person are you?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,I don't know.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Okay. ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, ""Do you date moving men?""",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Ah ha...,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,You wanna know what I said?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,I can't wait.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"""I do now.""",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Clever.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Is that something?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Yes.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Is that something?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Yes.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Hello! Jerry, so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY (clearly creeped out by having to shake Poppie's hand),"Hello, Poppie. This is Elaine.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Nice to meet you, Poppie.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Well, your mother must be very proud of you.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp, where she labored for twelve years. Finally, they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish, and she died...on the high seas.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"So, what's good tonight?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Why not?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"So, you won't eat the pizza?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,No way.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Really.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Yeah.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Really!,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Yeah. That's right.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child...",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh, boy.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (offended),Well...Poppie. I think differently.,5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,And what gives you the right to do that?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (standing up),"The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.",5,S06E05,6
WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE (to her date),"I heard that. Let's go, Henry.",5,S06E05,6
HENRY,But we just got here...,5,S06E05,6
WOMAN AT ANOTHER TABLE,"I'm with you, Poppie!",5,S06E05,6
WOMAN AT YET ANOTHER TABLE (to her date),Let's go!,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (to Poppie),And I am not coming back!,5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,You're not welcome!,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,I'm sorry I missed it.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Oh...pretty good.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"So, what's it about?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Holly Go-Lightly.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, she's quite a character.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,No.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Big surprise.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"You're not very bright, are you?",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Why don't you rent the movie?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER (scanning a menu),So...how was the dinner last night?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Oh...well...,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (sitting down),Oh...well...,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Alright, what did you do to Poppie?",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Nothing.,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,What's wrong with him?,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,We should get him something.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Yeah. You're right.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?",5,S06E05,6
CARL,"Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,You don't have any furniture?,5,S06E05,6
CARL,"No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it. (They laugh again.)",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?",5,S06E05,6
CARL,"Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes, then kiss.)",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE (opening the gift basket),What's this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? They're trying to kill Poppie?!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Why, what...?",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Well, we're not very close.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland.,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Oh, very good ducks.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,I'm in looove!,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Whoa!,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (putting on lipstick),"Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (looks at Jerry and smears lipstick across her face),What?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,What is his stand...on abortion?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,How do you know?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.,5,S06E05,6
CLERK (checking the computer),"Uh, this is out. Someone has it.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.",5,S06E05,6
CLERK,"Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.,5,S06E05,6
CLERK,"Oh, sorry. We can't do that.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.",5,S06E05,6
CLERK,I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.,5,S06E05,6
VOICE ON INTERCOM,Yes?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?",5,S06E05,6
INTERCOM,Yes.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,Hey.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Hey, what's happenin.'",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Okay. Hi, Poppie.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,Hello.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"That's fine. If you just give me my duck money, I'll be on my way.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.),5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,No.,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Kramer, did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother -",5,S06E05,6
JERRY (comes out of the bedroom with Poppie's money),"Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...(notices a large, wet stain on his couch)...the...the...",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"The what? (Looks at Kramer, and exits.)",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,...the...the...,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER (to Poppie),So long. I'll see you tonight.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY (frantic),"Kramer, Kramer, what is this?!",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,What is what?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,This puddle on my sofa!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,What puddle?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY (points),That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.),5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,I don't know.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY (looking at the puddle with Kramer),Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,Are you sure?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,I'm sure it'll come out.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Ah, you're making too much of it.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY (sarcastic),"Yeah, you're right. It's just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa, instead of in the toilet, where it would normally be.",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,Right!,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.",5,S06E05,6
JOE,"Well, I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,She was a delicate flower.,5,S06E05,6
JOE,Why didn't you just read the book?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)",5,S06E05,6
JOE,"Remy, this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffany's with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.)",5,S06E05,6
CARL,Hi.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Hi. (They kiss.),5,S06E05,6
CARL,I missed you.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Oh, I missed you!",5,S06E05,6
CARL,I don't remember the last time I felt this way.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Me, either!",5,S06E05,6
CARL,I think about you all the time.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,You do?,5,S06E05,6
CARL,Do you think about me?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.",5,S06E05,6
CARL,What friend?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)",5,S06E05,6
CARL,"You know, someday...we're going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"So, anything to uh, nosh?",5,S06E05,6
JOE,What did you want?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Popcorn?,5,S06E05,6
REMY,Popcorn? Where do you think you are?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.",5,S06E05,6
REMY,"Well, we don't.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.",5,S06E05,6
JOE (passes George a bowl),Here's some nuts.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.,5,S06E05,6
REMY (to Joe),"Can we watch the movie now, Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.)",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'",5,S06E05,6
JOE,"The lights are fine. (George shrugs, and the movie begins.)",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER (in a chef's hat and apron),"See, anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.)",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,Use your wrist! It's all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER (puts the dough on the counter),"Alright, put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese...",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,Not too much!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.),5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,Wait a second...what is that?,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,It's cucumbers.,5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"No, no. You can't put cucumbers on a pizza.",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"Well, why not? I like cucumbers.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,That's not a pizza. It'll taste terrible.,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"But that's the idea, you make your own pie.",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Yes, but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate!",5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?,5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,Because it's a pizza!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!,5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,It's a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough!,5,S06E05,6
KRAMER,"No, it isn't!",5,S06E05,6
POPPIE,"Yes, it is!",5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,I'm home.,5,S06E05,6
JOE,"Hey, honey.",5,S06E05,6
REMY,"Hi, Mom.",5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,"Hi, baby. (To George.) Hello. Breakfast At Tiffany's?",5,S06E05,6
JOE,Yeah.,5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,"Well, I just came back from Angela's, it's not looking very good for Duncan.",5,S06E05,6
JOE,"Aw, that's too bad.",5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,"Yeah, the doctor thinks it's just a matter of time -",5,S06E05,6
"GEORGE (clears his throat, annoyed that the movie's being interrupted)",Joe...could you...,5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,"Poor guy, I hate to see him suffer like this...",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.",5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,Who are you?,5,S06E05,6
JOE,This is George Costanza.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE (irritated),This is very hard to follow with all the talking.,5,S06E05,6
JOE,"I'll pause it, okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.)",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.),5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,Who is this guy?,5,S06E05,6
REMY,He's in some book club.,5,S06E05,6
JOE'S WIFE,And what's he doing here?,5,S06E05,6
REMY,Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.),5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.",5,S06E05,6
REMY,What?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"C'mon, you took my seat.",5,S06E05,6
REMY,It's not your seat.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"I was sitting there, c'mon.",5,S06E05,6
REMY,You didn't save it.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,I had the arm! Joe...,5,S06E05,6
JOE,What's the difference?,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...",5,S06E05,6
REMY,It's my couch.,5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)",5,S06E05,6
REMY,"Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch, you've ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.)",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,Joe...,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Oh my god.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,You see?!,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"So, you're gonna get a new couch?",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Well, I guess I have no choice.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Do you want your old couch back?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?",5,S06E05,6
INTERCOM,It's the movers.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,'Kay. (Buzzes them in.),5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Who's that?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"No, no, he's not my boyfriend.",5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Why?,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Take a guess.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Hi.,5,S06E05,6
CARL,Hi.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.",5,S06E05,6
CARL,Today?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,Could you?,5,S06E05,6
CARL,Sure.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (to Jerry),What are you doing with this couch?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,George is taking it.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Did you tell him it was peed on?,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.",5,S06E05,6
CARL,"I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, me too.",5,S06E05,6
CARL,It's just too bad.,5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Yeah. It is.,5,S06E05,6
CARL,"Well, I better get this couch back to Jerry's.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE,Can I offer you anything to drink?,5,S06E05,6
CARL (off-camera),"Yeah, sure.",5,S06E05,6
ELAINE (looking in the fridge),All I've got is grape juice.,5,S06E05,6
CARL,Throw it!,5,S06E05,6
CARL,The couch!,5,S06E05,6
"MARIE (describing Holly Go-Lightly in ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"")","She didn't want the constraints of any relationship, that's why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Holly's life was her independence.",5,S06E05,6
GEORGE,"Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.",5,S06E05,6
MARIE,George...Fred's gay.,5,S06E05,6
JERRY,"I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!""",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" thing.",6,S06E06,6

GEORGE,"Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Maybe you should date the mothers.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Oh, you got something goin'.",6,S06E06,6

JERRY,"Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Nah, I don't think so.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,(inside bathroom) Nah.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Oh, COME ON!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,A gymnast!,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(shuts door) ""Bailing""?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, you should pay that price.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Ch- oo-... what?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"(stares at George, incredulous) ""Back on""? What was it doing off?",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office"".",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,(laughing) What for?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Unbuttoned, or all the way off?",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"ALL the way, baby!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Of course.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,Always.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,What meeting?,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,Oh! (tries to take paper),6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,(pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,Yes?,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this office.,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Elaine?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Come in, come in!",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Ah, right there, yeah.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(rips open package) Yeah, that's...",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Kramer, it's...",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around),6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Oh, these are nice corners, huh?",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,I don't see it.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,I still don't see it.,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"A spaceship, where?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Kramer, what's wrong?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Mama!,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,(still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?,6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,"Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm sorry we've kept Lindsay so long.",6,S06E06,6
LINDSAY,Mother...,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.",6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,Oh? Are you and your family close?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.",6,S06E06,6
LINDSAY,"Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?",6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,Can I offer you anything to eat?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?",6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,"Oh no, George, you don't have to...",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"No, I know I don't have to, I want to.",6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,"George, you are such a gentleman.",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.",6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,(wide-eyed) Oh...,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,Where is it?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,(pointing) Right here.,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,I'm looking there!,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"No, no, unfocus.",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,I am unfocused!,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,(still staring at picture) Meeting?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,Why don't you go for me?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,How can I go?,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Oh, DAMN this thing!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!""",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,And you could not refuse.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"No, you'd have to be crazy.",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,He was a very bad dictator.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, ""What the hell, I'll just eat some trash.""",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Was it in the trash?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,Yes.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Then it was trash.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,But it was in the cylinder!,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,Above the rim.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Was it eaten?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,One little bite.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Well, that's garbage.",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Hey!,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Hey.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,What's with you?,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,I got a stone.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,What stone?,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,A kidney stone.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"What is that, anyway?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Oh, that's gotta hurt.",6,S06E06,6
ARONSON,"Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including the stock swap.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)",6,S06E06,6
BECK,"And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?",6,S06E06,6
BECK,Moland Spring.,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"(making a face) ""Moland""?",6,S06E06,6
ARONSON,"Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything called ""Moland"".",6,S06E06,6
ARONSON,But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?",6,S06E06,6
ARONSON,(to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Good for you.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Yes, good for me!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, what is your problem?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,No.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Tantric yoga?,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,No.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,All right.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,Did you pass your stone yet?,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"(smiling and excited) Well, here we are.",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,Yes. We are here.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,I can balance myself in any position.,6,S06E06,6
KATYA,"It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Oh boy...,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Well, what did you think she was gonna do?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"No, what?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,You mean like the uneven parallel bars?,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"See, again, I really don't feel that...",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,The balance beam?,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Could we stop?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,All right. Let's just drop it.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"I dunno, at least three weeks.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"(sarcastic) Oh, great.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Between Poland and Morgan?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,Yeah. Started a big name controversy.,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Kramer! The stone!,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"What happened, did you pass the stone?",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..."" (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)",6,S06E06,6
MAN IN CAR,Hey! What the hell was that?!,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-,6,S06E06,6
MAN IN CAR,Clean that up!,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.",6,S06E06,6
MRS. ENRIGHT,"(sees George cleaning car windshield, looks appalled)",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!",6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,Strike two!,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,You think I'm going down?,6,S06E06,6
JERRY,You're behind in the count.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,I know.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"All right, where you going?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.,6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Yeah, well you're going.",6,S06E06,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"(in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't send you over there to complain about the name.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"I like the name ""Moland"". I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating!",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Well, I'm so sorry! I-",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"(walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah!",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,"So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"""Greatest Show on Earth""!",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,"My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society.",6,S06E06,6
JERRY,"Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,"Ah, Misha!",6,S06E06,6
MISHA,Katya!,6,S06E06,6
KATYA,"Misha, this is Jerry.",6,S06E06,6
MISHA,"Ah, yes. The ""co-me-dian"", eh? (speaks in Romanian to Katya)",6,S06E06,6
KATYA,"(laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry)",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,(staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. You want DEEP focus!",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the meeting?",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,In about twenty minutes.,6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an ""Adolph Hitler""-style moustache) Do I have time to change?",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Um, no.",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,"Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there.",6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Uh, Mr. Pitt...",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,Yes?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,"Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)",6,S06E06,6
MR. PITT,(sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?,6,S06E06,6
ELAINE,No?,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,"Well, here we are.",6,S06E06,6
LINDSAY,Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.,6,S06E06,6
GEORGE,Maybe I could just use the bathroom.,6,S06E06,6
LINDSAY,Sure.,6,S06E06,6
ANNOUNCER,"(voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb.",6,S06E06,6
MISHA,It is time.,6,S06E06,6

GEORGE,I did it! It's all done!,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement),7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"I love the day date. No wine, No shower.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,There ya go.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,So the trip was good?,7,S06E07,6
SIMON,"Yes (nice English accent) Apart from that, dreadful airline food. It tends to reek havoc with my stomach.",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)",7,S06E07,6
SIMON,That's probably because of ... [muttering],7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,What?,7,S06E07,6
SIMON,What?,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, what?",7,S06E07,6

SIMON,"Where I come from, we don't say What? It's proper to say Pardon?",7,S06E07,6

KELLY,"So then about a year ago I started selling, these funky little hair clips. It's going pretty good. I make them in my apartment.",7,S06E07,6

KELLY,and I could use a few extra ... Careful,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.",7,S06E07,6
KELLY,That's a nice watch George.,7,S06E07,6

KELLY,"You know, my boyfriend has the same one.",7,S06E07,6

KELLY,"Yeah, he loves watches. He's a real watch freak.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Well, how about that?",7,S06E07,6
KELLY,Ooh look out. (pointing at the ground - squishing sound) You stepped right in it.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Yes, I sure did.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,So you just pretended it didnt bother you?,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)",7,S06E07,6

JERRY,"Oh, a walk, well --",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Or something. I said, Or Something!",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Or something. Yeah, that's a date.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,(snaps fingers) There you go.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,What do you mean?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Uh huh.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,I mentioned how I liked horse manure.,7,S06E07,6

JERRY,And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"My honest opinion, I think she made it up.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,Hey.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?",7,S06E07,6

JERRY,Another time? What other time?,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.",7,S06E07,6
BANIA,Soup's not a meal. You're supposed to buy me a meal.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,But I don't want anything but soup.,7,S06E07,6

BANIA,"Hey, I give you a brand-new Armani suit, and you won't even buy me a meal?",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"All right, fine. Get the soup!",7,S06E07,6

JERRY,I don't know? Consomm or something.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Consomm, hmm.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,What?,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Elaine you're missing the whole point.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,What?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Was it a cup or a bowl?,7,S06E07,6

JERRY,"As a mater of fact, he did.",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.",7,S06E07,6
SIMON,"Hello. (to Jerry, politely -- then quickly turns to Elaine) Elaine, do you have any cash on you?",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Um, yeah in my purse.",7,S06E07,6

GEORGE,"Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Ill have an egg white omelet.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Yeah, that was bad.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)",7,S06E07,6

JERRY,This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,What are you talking about? this isn't a meal.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,"You're supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant, like Mendys.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,I tried to do that.,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,This is lunch in a coffee shop,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.",7,S06E07,6
BANIA,"Ah, soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George)",7,S06E07,6
BANIA,Im really not comfortable ...,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,Yeah.,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.,7,S06E07,6

JERRY,Where's Simon?,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator),7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)",7,S06E07,6
SIMON,Hey mate. Fancy a beer?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Ah, no thanks.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Hey, what size suit are you?",7,S06E07,6
SIMON,40,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?",7,S06E07,6

JERRY,"Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Thanks,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Yo?,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,"Listen Jerry, I've been doing some thinking. I want my suit back.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,I don't have your suit. I gave it away.,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,Well it's my suit.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.,7,S06E07,6

JERRY,Ok.,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Nothing.,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,Really.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"All right, go ahead",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things),7,S06E07,6
HILDE,Did you find anything!,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"Uh, yeah, ah ...",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...",7,S06E07,6
HILDE,"Cheese is good. Yeah, what kind?",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"Uh, Swiss.",7,S06E07,6
HILDE,"All right, it'll have to do. Come on.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"Hey, What are you doing out here?",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Reggies? I can't eat anything there.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,It's the same menu.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,There's no Big Salad.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"All right. Let's go, to Reggies.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Ahh ... wait till you hear this.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.",7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.,7,S06E07,6
HILDE,(walks up to the table) Hello.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?",7,S06E07,6
HILDE,Did you read the menu?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,How bout a Big Salad?,7,S06E07,6
HILDE,A big salad?,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,(to George) Ya see?,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.",7,S06E07,6
HILDE,I can bring you 2 small salads.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Could you put it in a big bowl?,7,S06E07,6
HILDE,We don't have big bowls.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.,7,S06E07,6
HILDE,We have Sanka.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Not fair.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,"If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,She's on your turf.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,You're the best.,7,S06E07,6
GEORGE,Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.,7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.",7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.,7,S06E07,6
HILDE,(from Kramer's apartment) Food!,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,Why'd she get fired?,7,S06E07,6
KRAMER,"Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,"So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,"Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Yes. He's one of those bounders.,7,S06E07,6
KELLY,Egg white omelet and Big Salad.,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,AHhh. Thank you.,7,S06E07,6
KELLY,"I just wanted you guys know that Friday's my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips, thank God, I don't have to do this any more. (turns and walks away)",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,Ah (hu ha - small laugh),7,S06E07,6
BANIA,"Hey Jerry, where's my suit?",7,S06E07,6
JERRY,I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania),7,S06E07,6
MONK'S MANAGER,"(on the phone, we assume it's George calling) I told you, she's busy. She can't come to the phone now! (hangs up)",7,S06E07,6
MONK'S MANAGER,You better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here.,7,S06E07,6
KELLY,"Oh he's not my boyfriend. It's that bald guy with the glasses, who's always here with them. He's trying to get me in trouble.",7,S06E07,6
MONK'S MANAGER,"HEY! Yeah. I got a message for you. You tell your friend George, that the next time I see him around here, Im going to turn him into my Own, Personal, Hand-Puppet.",7,S06E07,6
SIMON,"Well, hello. Here you are as promised. You see, Im a man of my word. (drops keys into Elaine's extended palm)",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,When are you leaving?,7,S06E07,6
SIMON,"Elaine, are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but all of a sudden, I've been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due, to this suit. How do I look? Im a shoe-in aren't I. Thanks again love. (touches the table, turns and walks to the exit)",7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,(leans backwards from the counter) Yeah!,7,S06E07,6
ELAINE,There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door),7,S06E07,6
BANIA,Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You!,7,S06E07,6
SIMON,(from outside Monk's) What are you doing? Unhand me!,7,S06E07,6
BANIA,(from outside Monk's) Take It Off!,7,S06E07,6
CAR SALESMAN,"George, are you sure I can't show you any other cars?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.",8,S06E08,6
SALESMAN,I got a LeBaron convertible right here.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (chuckles),N.I. Not interested.,8,S06E08,6
SALESMAN,"It's got a few more miles on it, but the previous owner was John Voight.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (suddenly interested),Jon Voight?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,Was that Tim Whatley?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.),8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,Why?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Uh - new car!,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,Ohhh!,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Hey! Did you get the Volvo?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,A LeBaron?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,What Consumer? I'm the consumer.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,Jon Voight? The actor?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (boasting),That's right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (defensive),"No, no...",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Alright, maybe I do. So what.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Hey.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Hey.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,I like coffee.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"I like (imitates Kramer) ""cookies.""",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Alright, take 'em.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER (happily),Yeah-yah.,8,S06E08,6
POP,"Kramer, without you, we'd be out of business.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.",8,S06E08,6
MOM,So many sneakers!,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.",8,S06E08,6
POP,They'll be ready a week from Thursday.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.",8,S06E08,6
MOM,What's the matter?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.",8,S06E08,6
MOM,"Oh, lie down, and put your head back.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)",8,S06E08,6
POP,What?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER (stuffing tissue up his nose),"Well, you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous, you should call the electrician.",8,S06E08,6
POP,"You know, in the 48 years we've been here, I don't think we've ever called an electrician.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT,Elaine?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Yes, Mr. Pitt?",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT,Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"No, I'm still working on it.",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT,What in blazes are you listening to?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Artie Shaw. ""Honeysuckle Jump."" (The song ends.)",8,S06E08,6
DJ ON RADIO,"That was Artie Shaw, ""Honeysuckle Jump.""",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT,Elaine! How did you know that?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.",8,S06E08,6
DJ ON RADIO,"Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so, he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words ""Woody Woodpecker."") There are only three spots left. We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker.",8,S06E08,6
"MR. PITT (to Elaine, excited)",Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT,My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)",8,S06E08,6
DJ ON RADIO,"Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND. (The music starts. Elaine listens intently.)",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT (impatiently),"Well, Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,Will you shut up? I can't hear!,8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT,I'm sorry!,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Oh! I've got it! It's ""Next Stop Pottersville""! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)",8,S06E08,6
MR. PITT (overjoyed),"Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth, elated) Next Stop Pottersville, Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius!",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"What do you mean ""might""? You don't think he really owned this car?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,I don't know.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY (shuts the car door),"Alright, I'll change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.)",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (unimpressed),"Liam Neeson. You know, he's not American.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.),8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (singing),Everybody's talkin' at me...I can't hear a word they're sayin'...just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...,8,S06E08,6
JERRY (yelling from his room),Kramer! (We hear Kramer's door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Where's all my sneakers?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,You said take 'em.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Not all of 'em!,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,I can't wear these!,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, why not?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,They're uncomfortable.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Where did you get those?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,But I don't wanna be a cowboy!,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, I got one too.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Yeah?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Oh yeah? Huh.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,What?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"No, nothing.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"No, what is it?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,You didn't get one?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Not necessarily.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (mocking Jerry),That's the genius of it.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY (picks up the phone),I'm callin' Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (to Kramer),Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.),8,S06E08,6
KRAMER (impressed),Boss!,8,S06E08,6
POP,Four thousand dollars? We can't afford that!,8,S06E08,6
ELECTRICIAN,"Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to do something about it, because it's in violation of the building code. Otherwise, they're gonna close you up.",8,S06E08,6
POP,But what if we can't pay for it?,8,S06E08,6
ELECTRICIAN,"Then I have to report you. Otherwise, I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.)",8,S06E08,6
POP,"48 years, Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.)",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,So?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"C'mon, put the top up, it's November!",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"I feel alive, Jerry.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Ah! See? I told ya.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,So?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (pulls over),"So, what are you saying?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Nothing. I'm sure ""Jon"" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (angrily),Get out of the car!,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,What?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!",8,S06E08,6
JERRY (sarcastically),"Oh, look! There's Gregory Peck's bicycle!",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Get out!,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.),8,S06E08,6
TOUGH GUY (threatingly),"Hey, cowboy. Where's your horse? (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah, you better run!",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Did they take anything?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,You really seemed to enjoy it.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY (sarcastic),"Yeah, that's possible.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY (to Elaine),He'll dispose of it.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Yeah...,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"And I asked him, ""Should Jerry bring anything?""",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,So...?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Mmmm...and he said, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?""",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Alright, but let me ask you this question.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,What?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" or, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" You emphasize ""Jerry"" or ""bring.""",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"I think he emphasized ""would.""",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Hey.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Hey, so where's my sneakers?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,That's what I wanna know.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,What do you mean?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,So all my sneakers are gone?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE (amused),"So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Apparently.,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Alright, that's enough of this.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Where ya goin'?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"He finds his laugh ""intoxicating."" (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)",8,S06E08,6
MR. MORGAN,"So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.",8,S06E08,6
MR. MORGAN,"Jon Voight? The actor? (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh, I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.",8,S06E08,6
CONTEST WINNER (to Elaine),"I guessed Stan Herman's ""Boomtown Blues."" What'd you guess?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"Um, it was, uh...""Next Stop Pottersville."" (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?",8,S06E08,6
CONTEST WINNER,After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.),8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.),8,S06E08,6
VOIGHT,Taxi! (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"No Jon Voight Day, huh?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,You should have somebody take a look at that.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,You going to the party?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"No, I don't know if I'm invited.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Yeah, you're right.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Maybe I'll just meet you there.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,You don't want to go with me?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, he was a little standoffish.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"What, you didn't ask him about the car?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,What?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,His tooth marks. He bit me.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Jon Voight bit you?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Well, what is he, a vampire?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (looking at Kramer's arm),He left perfect imprints.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Oh, please.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"No, it's stupid.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.),8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.",8,S06E08,6
"JERRY (under his breath, to a man at the party)","Excuse me, uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,That's right. He's a troublemaker.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY (pointing at the trophy),"What is that, the Empire State Building?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,What? I can't hear you.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Elaine, would you marry me?",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,"I told you, I can't hear a word.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Alright. Forget it.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Hey, Tim.",8,S06E08,6
TIM,"Hey, George. Kramer, how ya doin.' (They shake hands.)",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.",8,S06E08,6
TIM,"No, it's no problem, what is it?",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)",8,S06E08,6
GUY,"Alright Tim, I'm gonna get goin.'",8,S06E08,6
TIM,"Alright, let me take down your number. (Grabs George's pencil, then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.),8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Uh, Tim, the pencil...",8,S06E08,6
TIM,Jerry.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Hey, Tim.",8,S06E08,6
TIM,Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Did you say, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"" or, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show""? (Elaine comes over.)",8,S06E08,6
TIM,Elaine! Hi!,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,Tim.,8,S06E08,6
TIM,Well. I'm really glad you came.,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE,What?,8,S06E08,6
TIM,Really glad you came.,8,S06E08,6
ELAINE (deaf),Uh huh.,8,S06E08,6
TIM (picks up a bowl of nuts),"Listen, Elaine, I've been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut, and shakes her head no. Tim, rejected, walks away.) Thanks.",8,S06E08,6
ELAINE (puzzled),What? What?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?,8,S06E08,6
DENTIST,It's possible.,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (to Kramer),Roll up your sleeve.,8,S06E08,6
DENTIST,Somebody bit you?,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Not just someone. Jon Voight.,8,S06E08,6
DENTIST,"Jon Voight bit you? (George notices Tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) The pencil! Hey, hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth, you're destroying Jon Voight's teeth marks!",8,S06E08,6
TIM,That's John Voight's pencil?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.,8,S06E08,6
TIM,Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible?,8,S06E08,6
GEORGE (overjoyed to find out),"Yes! Yes, I'm the one! Hey! So, you know Jon Voight!",8,S06E08,6
TIM,"Yes! Yes, I went to dental school with him.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,"Jon Voight, the actor?",8,S06E08,6
TIM,No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.),8,S06E08,6
DENTIST,Can't this wait until Monday? Come by my office.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.,8,S06E08,6
DENTIST,Alright. Sit down.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY (sits down),"It's this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back, and knocks Elaine's trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.)",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!,8,S06E08,6
TIM (to Jerry),"Hey, who invited you, anyway? You're a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.)",8,S06E08,6
ANNOUNCER ON TV,"Hey, it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact, he's collapsing.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Those kids look pretty disappointed.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?",8,S06E08,6
GUY ON PHONE,"Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,Yes it is.,8,S06E08,6
GUY ON PHONE,"You don't know me, but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale, and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.",8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Where are they?,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,"Parsippany, New Jersey.",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Let's go!,8,S06E08,6
JERRY,My car's in the shop.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,"Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?",8,S06E08,6
KRAMER,Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.,8,S06E08,6
JERRY (wipes Kramer's brow),Maybe we should get you to a hospital.,8,S06E08,6
KRAMER (a la Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy),"Hey, I ain't goin' to no Bellevue! Look at me, I'm fallin' apart here.",8,S06E08,6
GEORGE,Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,From your mother.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"That's a 180, George.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,Whatever.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Hi Willie.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,Hey Jerry.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,What are you doing with it?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.",9,S06E09,6
DONNA,Hi.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Hi.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Hey Jerry, you know my wife Donna.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah, that's why I said hi.",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Hey, nice jacket. (looking over the jacket)",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Whoa, this is a beauty. Great cut. It's probably very flattering.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.",9,S06E09,6
APPLICANT,"Well, I type about 90 words a minute. Im completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in),9,S06E09,6
ADE,"As you can see my references are impeccable. I think Id be a real asset here. My only concern is, I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights?",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,I can't imagine.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Yeah.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,I thought we were going to the movies?,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes),9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,Hey hey.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Hey George,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Because you didnt have a job?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,It's a little ...,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,You got no waist in that thing.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"I said, All Right.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,Well whad you buy it for?,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"") Moore in Indecent Proposal.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,How fast was she walking?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Demi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"")? I thought it was Demi?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"No. I think it's Demi. (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"")",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Really? I never heard of a semi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,What?,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Oh, you're crazy.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Good idea.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Yeah yeah, ok.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,yeah.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Well we could ...,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.",9,S06E09,6
ADE,Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then it's only finger foods.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"OK, now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag, so it is definitely doable.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"Well thank you, Im flattered.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"Well Im just, hm, doing my job.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.",9,S06E09,6
ADE,What can I say? Im ... Im good at what I do. (smiling and quietly laughing proudly),9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"(thinking about the question, she stops writing) Yes, I think I do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him)",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Is it, uh, doable?",9,S06E09,6
ADE,It's definitely doable.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Well, that was the worst.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.,9,S06E09,6
MAN,"(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!",9,S06E09,6
Another man,"(waiting in line, closer to the box office) Yeah! (in agreement with the other guy)",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,You got a pen?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I think I do.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,And I need something to write on.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Uma Therman? Really?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,How'd you manage that.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Where?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,What would he be doing wearing your jacket?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Are you sure?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,You are amazing.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket, then go around the back of the shirt.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,Ade you are incredible,9,S06E09,6
ADE,"Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here, I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"What? Oh, My God!",9,S06E09,6
ADE,Mr. CO STAN ZA!,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,Yeah.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Not that Im aware of, no.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,I didnt think ahead.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,I didnt say any other bawdy things.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"All right, all right. Im sorry.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,How long has she been there?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,3 days.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,It's almost a week.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Oh, My god.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,What?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.",9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"Well, we're more than happy to exchange it for something else.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator),9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,Ill bring it to your dressing room.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,I like your little bag.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Huh.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Hey Kramer.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. That's a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit),9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Well, thank you.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Did you get that here?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,You're telling me.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,I sure am.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,It's hard for me to find pants that --,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Yes,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Me too.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,What size are you?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Uh, 42.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"42, That's what I am now. I've been working out, Im huge. How'd you like to sell it?",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,make me an offer.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,100 Bucks,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania),9,S06E09,6
BANIA,175,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,300 dollars.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,You throw the shirt in?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Bania, you're killing me.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Hey that's the women's dressing room.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?",9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- Im a very accessible man. I just wanted to say you're doing great work on that Canola oil stuff.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.",9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,"Ade, Ade, I like that name George.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room),9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,Is that a fact George?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)",9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.,9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,"What's that cost her, like, two and a quarter? ($2.25)",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.,9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,"You know, she'd be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello, ah, George will you excuse me.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Psst. Hey.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Kramer, what are you doing here?",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,What?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,So go buy a new one.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,So.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Hello, Willie.",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Hey, Jerry. You dropping off?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,You came by to ask that?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,What are you gettin at?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,Jerry that's a breach of the dry-cleaners code.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,I wasn't wearing your jacket. Jerry you're imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international symbol for insane),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,Jerry.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Jerry, come on.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Now.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife Donna),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,Well ... ahh. (apprehensively),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Wait, you, you mean to tell me you don't have a ticket for the coat?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"No, not on me.",9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Well, I, I need to see that ticket.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.,9,S06E09,6
WILLIE,"Yeah, but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You cant, get anything without a number.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"All right, Ill be back.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?",9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"So, uh, do you want it?",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"I cant thank you enough, Mr. Costanza. Im so grateful",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)",9,S06E09,6
ADE,It was just so generous.,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"Oh I know, but Twenty Five Thousand.",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.",9,S06E09,6
ADE,"Yes, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner...",9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,You're making more than I am.,9,S06E09,6
ADE,I am?,9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.,9,S06E09,6
ADE,Well apparently they can.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Hey, what do you think of this?",9,S06E09,6
MAN,(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.,9,S06E09,6
FEMALE CUSTOMER,"Hey, what's going on in there?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?",9,S06E09,6
FEMALE CUSTOMER,This woman has been in there for over an hour.,9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"Excuse me Miss., Is everything ok in there?",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,[Yeah] (through the door),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Kramer?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,What clothes?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Didnt Elaine call you?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,No.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Well what are you doing here?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Where are your pants?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Well, I sold them to Bania.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Where are your clothes?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,I told you I sold them to Bania.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,You mean what you were wearing?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,How'd you expect to get out of here?,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Well, I didnt think ahead.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.,9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,No.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,No?,9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,"No, because you're taking that one.",9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,I am?,9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,Yes. Because you wore it out of the store.,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Ha! That's preposterous.,9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,I suppose that salt stain came from all the snow in the store.,9,S06E09,6
BARNEY'S SALES ASSOCIATE,Shall I wrap it or will you wear it out?,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,[Elaine],9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,Jerry?,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"Elaine, where's Kramer?",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Bania?,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Kramer.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Jerry.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Bania.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"Kramer, I want my money back for this suit. You're nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room),9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Umas number is on that ticket.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,I got an idea.,9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,What?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Pretty good.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back, and you'll get your ticket.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Can we go back to Mendys?,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Twice? I wanna go twice.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Two Mendys.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Here you go.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room),9,S06E09,6
GEORGE,"But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.",9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,"Uh huh, I understand what you're saying George and I know what it's like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies.",9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,I couldn't look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets.,9,S06E09,6
STEINBRENNER,"Sure I like a cup cake every now and then, like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside, it's a surprise. That's good, plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just cant even make up my mind. A lot of times Ill mix the two together, make a vanilla fudge.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,"(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.",9,S06E09,6
KRAMER,(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,(looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,The ticket is worthless.,9,S06E09,6
BANIA,You promised me.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?",9,S06E09,6
DONNA,No it's not. (the coat),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.,9,S06E09,6
DONNA,"No, what are you talking about.",9,S06E09,6
DONNA,Are you out of your mind? Don't you ... take your hands ...,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"You cant have that coat, it's not yours.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?",9,S06E09,6
DONNA,Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it,9,S06E09,6
ELAINE,"(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Mmm. This soup is great.,9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry, the best. Are you enjoying it?",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't),9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry, I was thinking. For our next meal, do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has it's pros and cons. On the one hand, here, you're guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand --",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,"Yeah. Well, lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"Oh, and who might that be?",9,S06E09,6
BANIA,Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope she's good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air),9,S06E09,6
JERRY,"If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.",9,S06E09,6
JERRY,Ready to go Lois?,10,S06E10,6
LOIS,You really like to say my name? Don't you?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.,10,S06E10,6
LOIS,"Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry.",10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,Jerry Seinfeld!,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Duncan Meyers!,10,S06E10,6
LOIS,You two know each other?,10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,"Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we Jerry? Gee I hope you're not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do.",10,S06E10,6
LOIS,Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?",10,S06E10,6
LEW,You no order Chicken Cashew.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.,10,S06E10,6
LEW,Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,What list?,10,S06E10,6
LEW,"The ""do not deliver"" list.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Ned must have left it here.,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Maybe he's just ""very well RED""?",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. ""Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important."" . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Hi oh.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE & GEORGE,Hey.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Where's Lois?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,She couldn't make it.,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,Duncan Meyers?,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Who's he?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Uh uh,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,What's that?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Oh, of course.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,No.,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,I looked up. I couldn't believe it.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Really?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,Well what happened when you raced him again?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,So now Duncan is back?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!,10,S06E10,6

LOIS,About what?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Oh, nothing in particular.",10,S06E10,6
LOIS,. . . Why did you cheat in that race?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,I did not cheat.,10,S06E10,6
LOIS,He said that you got a head start.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.",10,S06E10,6

NED,"Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba,",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, but come on . . .",10,S06E10,6
NED,I know it's not the same.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.",10,S06E10,6
NED,"Yeah, we had a good run.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,So you lied to her?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Well, I'm dating a communist.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Wow, a communist. That's something.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?",10,S06E10,6

GEORGE,What's up?,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.,10,S06E10,6

MICKEY,"Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here.",10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?",10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,That's what I've always wondered about.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Well, I . . . [sees George]",10,S06E10,6

JERRY,Well you've really built yourself up into something.,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.",10,S06E10,6

GEORGE,"Oh, the big race.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Yeah.,10,S06E10,6

DUNCAN,Miss Stafford?,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,George!,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Did I get a head start?,10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"Head start, oh no absolutely not.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,You satisfied? So you see?,10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,"No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be.",10,S06E10,6
LOIS,Why don't the two of you just race again?,10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,That's a good idea.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,"No, no, no, another race - out of the question.",10,S06E10,6
DUNCAN,"I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me now.",10,S06E10,6
LOIS,Race him Jerry. Race him.,10,S06E10,6
JERRY,All right! I'll do it. The race is on.,10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,. . . shut up! (?),10,S06E10,6
JERRY,And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus,10,S06E10,6
KRAMER,"Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.",10,S06E10,6
MICKEY,What does that mean?,10,S06E10,6
KRAMER,"Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.",10,S06E10,6
MICKEY,So what if I want to open up a delicatessen?,10,S06E10,6
KRAMER,There are no delicatessens under Communism.,10,S06E10,6
MICKEY,Why not?,10,S06E10,6
KRAMER,"Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.",10,S06E10,6
MICKEY,So you can't get Corned Beef?,10,S06E10,6
KRAMER,"Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.",10,S06E10,6
GEORGE,"(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right.

ELAINE,I'm going to order Chinese Food.,10,S06E10,6
NED,"You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,"Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.",10,S06E10,6
NED,"Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how to survive.",10,S06E10,6
ELAINE,You're father was blacklisted?,10,S06E10,6
NED,"Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They ""named names"".",10,S06E10,6

KID,But I want a racing car set.,10,S06E10,6
KRAMER,"You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.",10,S06E10,6
KID,"Hey, this guy's a COMMIE!",10,S06E10,6
MICKEY,"Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh?",10,S06E10,6

GEORGE,Sir?,10,S06E10,6
STEINBRENNER,"You could be invaluable to this franchise. George, there's a southpaw down there nobody's been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez, I don't really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away.",10,S06E10,6

STEINBRENNER,"Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well...",10,S06E10,6
MICKEY,"That was quick! Nice job, Santa!",10,S06E10,6

CASTRO,"And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, I would not have been able to get away with that one.",10,S06E10,6
JERRY,Come on. Lets go,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.",11,S06E11,6

ELAINE,"Uh, no. Not really.",11,S06E11,6
LANDIS,You know you should keep in touch. Something may be opening up in a few weeks. Is that a Bruline?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Newman plays tennis?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,He's fantastic.,11,S06E11,6

ELAINE,Thanks,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,You loaned her Pitt's racquet?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.,11,S06E11,6
SANDY,I gotta get going.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.",11,S06E11,6
SANDY,(nods silently),11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Bye,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Bye bye,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Have you noticed she never laughs,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Hm, really?",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Yeah,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Check that out (showing newspaper),11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Whoa, you're dating this woman?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,That's right.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,What's that.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Maybe she's bulimic,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Wa?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Bulimic,",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Kramer, she's a model.",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Exactly,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,There you go monkey boy.,11,S06E11,6
NINA,"Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Just enjoying watching you.,11,S06E11,6
SANDY,So did you like the movie?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.",11,S06E11,6
SANDY,(nods silently),11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.,11,S06E11,6
SANDY,(nods silently) That's funny.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,I'm glad you enjoyed it.,11,S06E11,6
NINA,"Oh, I'm so full.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.",11,S06E11,6
NINA,Will you excuse me.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Where you going?,11,S06E11,6
NINA,I just need to freshen up.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.,11,S06E11,6
NINA,"George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"See, what did I tell ya?",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, ""That's funny."" ... That's funny!",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Well, I heard a noise.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,What noise?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"You know, .. blah ...",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,What blah?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,From the bathroom.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Oh, you think she was refunding?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,So you're concerned.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,In a manner of speaking.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Here's your scrubber back.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Thanks.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,A matron?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Yeah,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Wha?,11,S06E11,6

GEORGE,You know a matron?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Me?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,You,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,No.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Kramer,",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Well, now look, just leave me alone.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Well, what is it?",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"No, don't, don't make me",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Wha?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"No, I can't, all right I can't ...",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Who?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,... My mother's a matron!,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Babs?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Why not? Why not?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Come on, Kramer.",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,I can't I can't,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Kramer you're going to have to face her some time,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,(mumbles) b'd b'd,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?",11,S06E11,6
LANDIS,I tore my umeral epicondilitist,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Oh,11,S06E11,6
LANDIS,My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Oh, you'll be playing ...",11,S06E11,6
LANDIS,If I can't play tennis I don't know what I'll do.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,",11,S06E11,6

ELAINE,(sees racquet) Could I ...,11,S06E11,6
LANDIS,If I can't play tennis I have no reason to live .. (cries),11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Ma?,11,S06E11,6
BABS,Cosmo!,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Cosmo?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Why didn't you just ask her for it?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Yeah,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Hey di ho,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,C'mon up.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,He'll only play with his racquet,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,That's stealing?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,I know.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Hey oh.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,JERRY Hey,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,So what happened with Kramer's mother?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,What's she like?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Ah, I'm ready what?",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,What is it?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,I uh got the first name.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,You found out Kramer's first name?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,That's right. You ready?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Cosmo,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,JERRY Cosmo?,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Cosmo,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,JERRY Cosmo,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Cosmo, Cosmo?",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,What's so funny? ... wha?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,COSMO?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,It's not such a bad name.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!,11,S06E11,6
LAURA,Yes?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Hi, is Sandy here?",11,S06E11,6
LAURA,"Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want to come in?",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,I would except I forgot to bring a towel.,11,S06E11,6
LAURA,(laughs nicely),11,S06E11,6
JERRY,So the roommate laughed at everything I said.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Wow.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ""ha's."" You know those?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Yeah.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,I see.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Can't be done, huh?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,The Switch?,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"""The Switch.""",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Can't be done.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,I wonder.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"All right, dammit, I'm in.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,I couldn't do it without you.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,All right. Let's get to work.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,We'll come up with something.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Yeah, sure we will.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,That's right.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Keep going.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Continue.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, ""If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.""",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.",11,S06E11,6
KEITH,Can I help you?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Uh, no, I'm OK.",11,S06E11,6
KEITH,Well then what are you doing with that racquet?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.",11,S06E11,6
KEITH,"Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no..",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.",11,S06E11,6
KEITH,Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what you're doing here. But...,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,All right. I'm going I'm going,11,S06E11,6
KEITH,Not with ...,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Give it give it ..,11,S06E11,6
KEITH,Leave ...,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?,11,S06E11,6
KEITH,I don't have to but I will.,11,S06E11,6
CLOTWORTHY,Morning Cosmo,11,S06E11,6

KRAMER,"You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.",11,S06E11,6
BABS,"Yes, well isn't that just easy for you to say. What the hell do you think I'm going to do with myself?",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?,11,S06E11,6
BABS,I've been clean for two years. Anyway what would we do together?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,I've got plenty of ideas.,11,S06E11,6

JERRY,"Ah, that's a shame.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.",11,S06E11,6

GEORGE,Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,If only something like that could happen to me.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,I know.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?",11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,"No, I got caught.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,What do you mean you got caught?,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Hey.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Hi Cosmo.,11,S06E11,6
ELAINE,Hi Cosmo,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Thanks man.,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,"Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Yeah,11,S06E11,6
JERRY,Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,"Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.",11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,She quit.,11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,"Don't talk to me George, talk to her.",11,S06E11,6
GEORGE,Well where is she?,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,I don't know.,11,S06E11,6
KRAMER,Ma!,11,S06E11,6
BABS,Cosmo!,11,S06E11,6
NEWMAN,"We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?",11,S06E11,6
JERRY,You sure you don't want the tickets?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,No thanks.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Maybe he didn't know?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Wish I could help you.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What do you think?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Aah.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Hey, is that Tim Whatley?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,The Dentist?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Oh good.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,Hey Jerry! George. What are you up to?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I'm getting a makeover.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"What, are you kidding?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"How can I think you? I'll tell you what, I'll take you to dinner sometime. You ever been to Mendys?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,No no no. No dinner.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Come in.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Where can I put this?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What is it?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Will he take it? I gotta go to work.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Take what?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,So why don't you leave it at Newman's?,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"I wanted to, he won't let me.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,So that's here?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,I don't wanna be Switzerland.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,Don't look at me.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Alright, so you're gonna look after it?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Stay strong buddy.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Yeah.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Watch it good.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Ok.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Hey.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Hey.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Tim Whatley?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Yeah. Who sent you that one?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,One Tim Whatley!,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Not, my Tim Whatley?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, perhaps.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Well how did he react when you gave it to him?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Um, he said, ""Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?""",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,He repeated the name of the gift?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, so?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,What do you mean?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, ""Oh. Tube socks."" What are you gonna do about it?",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Why'd you get him a gift anyway?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"Well, here we are. This is the place.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Wow.,12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Do you like it?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Are you a velvet fan?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"Aren't they great? (sees a man enter from the bedroom) Oh, Scott, hi. This is George. George, this is Scott, my roommate.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,(bewildered) Heh heh.,12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"Here, check out this view. If you lean out this window, you can see the river.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"So Scott's your roommate, huh?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"Yes. Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"No, you didn't mention it.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"He's a great guy, you'll really like him.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I'm sure I will.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Male roommate, huh?",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Yes. A male roommate.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Is this a problem?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Well, maybe he's --",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"No. Believe me, he's not.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,So he's an eligible receiver.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What's stopping them?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What does he look like?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,He looks like you and he's working from the inside?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Not you.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,We'll take a check please.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I've said that before?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,(entering) Hey.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Hey.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Hey.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,So what?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Are you through?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,The wedding is off? What happened?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Well, didn't he regift the label maker?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Possibly.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,You may have a point.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I have a point, I have a point.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Alright, I'll call him.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Yeah. What's that?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Thanks.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What are you gonna do about the roommate?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Well, the pickle breath is a good start.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry, may I come in?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What do you want?,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"(squeezing himself through the narrow space) Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,Jerry? I'm a little insulted.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"(leaving) Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,You're going to the Super Bowl?,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What's his name?,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,Tim Whatley.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,That's my ticket!,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,(as Newman leaves) Newman!,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,What a movie. Good choice.,12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Thank Scott. He recommended it.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Yes he is.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,George?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"George, you're being ridiculous.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,What's the massage situation?,12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,What do you mean?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"George, would you just stop?",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"George, what is wrong with you?",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!",12,S06E12,6
SCOTT,Hey!,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Hey!,12,S06E12,6
SCOTT,How ya going?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I'm good.,12,S06E12,6
SCOTT,(to Bonnie) Are you gonna need the bathroom? 'Cause I'm gonna jump in the shower.,12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"No, just throw my bras out of the way.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Well, this is my building.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Yes it is.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"This was fun, you know?",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Yeah.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"So, I'll call.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?,12,S06E12,6
TIM,Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,I would love to go upstairs.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,We'll see.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Newman. He's going with Newman.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Newman's his mailman.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Well, he's merry.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,What about the label maker?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Ah, well.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,No.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Then how'd you get up there?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?""",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,And there's you ticket.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,What?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Why?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Obviously.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,You're crazy.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Well, what happened when you got upstairs?",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Hey.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Hey. What are you doing?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,I'm watching your door.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,My door?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,(still outside) What was that?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Newman!,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,(fleeing to the bedroom) Damn!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,(after entering) The bedroom!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"I see you, Newman! I see you!",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,I've got a confession to make.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,Oh? What's that?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,I've got Super Bowl fever.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Oh yeah, me too.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,So where are we staying?,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Oh, the Ambassador.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Oh. Big room?,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"It's a regular room, but it's right downtown.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,Downtown?,12,S06E12,6
TIM,Right downtown.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"What do they have there, a couple of beds?",12,S06E12,6
TIM,Why? You bringing someone else?,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"Oh, a cactus.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.",12,S06E12,6
SCOTT,"Well, look who's here.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,I asked Scott to move out.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Oh. Oh!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,So she kicked him out of the apartment.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,That's right. It's just me and her.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,That's not a good role for you.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"No, it's not.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Oh my god.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,He was shouldering.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Where are you going?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,Thanks.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Alright, I'll see you later.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,Hey Jerry?,12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Are you serious, what about Elaine?",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they would.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,What are you doing?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,I'm taking the board with me.,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"So, I guess I'll see you at the game.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Yeah, see you there.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"Hi, George.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,It's gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"They were his. Besides, we don't need any of those things. We have each other.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,Are you sure you know where the impound yard is?,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Oh, stop stalling. Come on.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"I can't think, there's all this noise.",12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.",12,S06E12,6
UKRAINIAN,I come from Ukraine. You not say Ukraine weak.,12,S06E12,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.",12,S06E12,6
UKRAINIAN,Ukraine is game to you?! Howbout I take your little board and smash it!!,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Hello, Tim.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"(startled) Elaine, hi.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,But you gave it to me.,12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Uh, ok.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"You don't have the label maker, do you?",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Uh, no.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,I knew it! You're a regifter!,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Oh, yeah, some gift. That thing didn't work at all.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,What?,12,S06E12,6
TIM,"You put a label on something, then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got.",12,S06E12,6
ELAINE,"(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.",12,S06E12,6
TIM,"Oh, Elaine!",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.",12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. Tim couldn't make it, he's in love. Isn't that wonderful?",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,"Oh, it's enchanting.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Hi.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,"George, Scott's gonna drop by. He said he never got his boxes. I'll get the towels.",12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Here we are.,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,What is it?,12,S06E12,6
GEORGE,"Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?",12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,What?,12,S06E12,6
SCOTT,Hi.,12,S06E12,6
BONNIE,Scott! Remember what we talked about the other day? George is into it.,12,S06E12,6
SCOTT,Oh really?!,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"Great streak of luck I'm having. First, Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped, and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,Can you move over at all?!,12,S06E12,6
NEWMAN,"And then, just as I'm about to go, these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels, Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR, oh it's unbelievable.",12,S06E12,6
JERRY,An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?,12,S06E12,6
GARY,Hey George.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,I know. I've been pretty busy.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Mostly chemotherapy. 'Kay, I'll see you.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!,13,S06E13,6
COP,(at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,So you called the cop a pig?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Didn't you explain that to the cop?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"No, I fled the scene.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,(to George) Hey.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,(to George) Hey buddy.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Hey, uh...",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,What?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,Oh. What about?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Kramer...,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Hey, you're hurting me!",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"You gonna share it with me next time, huh?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"I swear, I swear!",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Oh yeah, I knew.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,You knew? How did you know?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,He told me a few months ago.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Why did he tell you and not me?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,I don't know.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,How are you closer to him than me?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"So, is he okay?",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"No, he was on his regular bed.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,So why didn't you tell me?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,He swore me to secrecy.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,So?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,It's not like you're my wife.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Well, I still think you shoulda told me.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Well, I wanna talk to him about this.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"That's right, you let him have it.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Mmm-mm.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,That's what I'm saying.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,His illness is your business.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"If not mine, whose?",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"If not now, when?",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Were you just talking about me?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"No, an old friend of ours, Gary.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Oh, the guy with cancer?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"If I told you, you woulda given it away.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,You don't think I can keep a secret?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"No, but he would've read your face.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,You don't trust my poker face?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Do you ever win at poker?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(shamefaced) No.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Egh, Jake Jarmel?",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Why? You don't wear glasses.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,Ah.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"You know, we had a really bad break-up.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,The Jujy Fruits?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,"Okay, K-Man, enjoy the book.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,I can't tell you that.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,So you don't know where you got 'em?,13,S06E13,6
JAKE,Yes I do. But I don't want anyone else to have them.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,Really?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Oh, I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Well frankly, you can't keep a secret. You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Well I still think it was wrong.,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Right, well I'm sorry, all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(well, obviously) Yes.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.",13,S06E13,6
COP,Yeah? So why didn't you?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,Scared of being shot.,13,S06E13,6
COP,"Mr Kramer, let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid, and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him, only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face, but he's become my 'white whale'. Mr Kramer, that day was yesterday! But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again!",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,I like that eye patch.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"(standing) Hey, George, listen. You know that company I work for, they own that parking lot around the corner.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Wha, that's a Kinney lot?",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Yeah, and there's a space opening up, and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. It'd be like, fifty a month.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"All right, I got lunch, all right.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,You still owe me a secret.,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"All right, listen. There is something I haven't told you, all right?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Yeah?,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Yeah, but uhm, you can't tell Jerry.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Okay. Well, the thing is, I've been living a lie.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Well, I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) I'll see you. (leaves)",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,I never heard her say hi.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Well, it's uh, common courtesy.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,It's like a game of tag.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Where you going?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Nowhere.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,So what if I do? (heads for the door),13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Hey. How'd it go with Gary?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,(suspicious) Really?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(shifty) Yeah.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,You look like something's on your mind.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table),13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"So, that's your poker face.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,My regular face.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,What are you saying?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,I got nothing.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"What you got, a pair of bullets?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,What you talking about?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Two pair? Three of a kind?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Will you stop it?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,I don't have a flush.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,You're saying you didn't say hi.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,That's what I'm saying.,13,S06E13,6
JAKE,So that's what you came down here to tell me?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Correct.,13,S06E13,6
JAKE,You never said hi?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Correct.,13,S06E13,6
JAKE,"You still like me, don't you?",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Correct. (catches herself) What's that?,13,S06E13,6
MAN,"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,"Elaine, coming down here to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,So what was wrong with him?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Nothing!,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,So he's been lying to me for two months?!,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,That's right.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Well...,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,I don't even think you could do it.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Oh, I could do it.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I guess you could.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(snorts) C'mon.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,You did that?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Why not?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Yeah.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Why didn't he tell me?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Because you were being so nice.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,I don't think I can be that nice.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(shouts) You be nice!,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Gary?,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"What d'you think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions, turning his head side to side, to show off the hairpiece)",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Is that from my gift certificate?,13,S06E13,6
GARY,Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. You've been so nice. (shakes Jerry by the hand),13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Hey, you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm getting rid of all my fillings, 'cos that mercury's toxic. Hey, let me see your fillings.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,I don't think so.,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Oh come on, open up. Let me take a look.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE (V.O.),You be nice! He's giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space...,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"(peering in) Well, what d'you know. Hey, lookee there, you're loaded.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Okay. (shuts mouth),13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Hey, look who's over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out, Jack! (rises)",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,(to Jerry) Hey buddy.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,It's an eyepatch.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,You look like a pirate.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,I wanna be a pirate.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,(gesturing) This is Gary.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,(to Gary) How you doing?,13,S06E13,6
GARY,All right.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Well, I tell you there's only one problem.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Can't see on your right side?,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy",13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,Nice car.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.,13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.",13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,I didn't say hi.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,You didn't?,13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"Uh, no. I told him to send you my regards. I didn't say hi.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Regards?,13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"Yeah, regards.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?",13,S06E13,6
CABBIE,(heavy accent) Smugness is not a good quality.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.",13,S06E13,6
CABBIE,Good. Revenge is very good.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?",13,S06E13,6
GUY,Yes?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?",13,S06E13,6
GUY,Malaysia.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Malaysia?,13,S06E13,6
GUY,Yeah.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?",13,S06E13,6
GUY,"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,(positive) Oh! (little chuckle),13,S06E13,6
GUY,"But I, I can barely see without these.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,C'mon.,13,S06E13,6
GUY,"Well, these were expensive.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Let's start the bidding.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"So, you didn't think this was a date?",13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"N... no, not really. Why, is it... a date?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,I thought it was a date.,13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,No. It's not a date.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,What about the regards?,13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"Regards don't mean anything. I mean, it's not like I said hi. Hey, the fact is... (sighs) I shouldn't say anything.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"No, tell me.",13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,Can you keep a secret?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Me? Oh yeah.,13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"(deep breath) I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But, h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Hey, do you know what the Whip does?",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,What whip?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"She won't talk to anyone, huh? Oh no, she won't say a word to anybody. Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack!",13,S06E13,6
COP,"Well, well. The 'white whale'.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.",13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"Don't complain, at least you have your health.",13,S06E13,6
DEBBY,"George, look out for that man!",13,S06E13,6
COP,"(to escaping car) Hey! Hey, get back here!",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,No. Definitely not.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Yeah.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,The one who always sits by herself?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Yeah!,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,How did he do that?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(opening door to leave) He picked her up?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Walked right over to her table.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,Where did you get those?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,Malaysia. I was in the area.,13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,(surprised) Kramer.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,Just drive.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.",13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,(defensive) What're you talking about...,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.",13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,"All right, so it's me. So what?",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.",13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,"I can't sleep, I tell you! I can't sleep!",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?",13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?,13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,"(sobbing) Yes, it's been awful. I wanted to tell somebody. (pleading) Help me Kramer! Help me!",13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,"It's no secret that it's my dream to have my own publishing house, and if this Jake Jarmel book does, you know, what I think it's gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground, then , you know, I think I'll have something for you. (laughs)",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,"Yeah, by the way, those are great glasses.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Oh really, you like 'em?",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,Uh huh. Very unusual.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Well, you know what? (removes glasses)",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,What?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,(hands them over) You can have 'em.,13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,"Oh, no no no. (waves them away) Please.",13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,Really?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,(accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses.,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,They're from Malaysia.,13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,(putting on spectacles) Oh yeah?,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,(admiring gasp) Fabulous.,13,S06E13,6
JUDGE,"Well Mr Newman, in all my years on the bench, I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and I've decided that what's best for the city and possibly for yourself, is for you to keep your car, in a garage...",13,S06E13,6
JUDGE,...convenient to your home.,13,S06E13,6
NEWMAN,(sobbing) I can't afford that!,13,S06E13,6
JUDGE,"Afford it you will, Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded...",13,S06E13,6
JUDGE,...and sold at auction.,13,S06E13,6
KRAMER,"Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"(unimpressed) I, really can't say.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"No, say. I want you to say.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.",13,S06E13,6
SALESMAN,You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.",13,S06E13,6
SALESMAN,"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!",13,S06E13,6
SALESMAN,"(getting annoyed) No, I don't think you're being helpful! I think you're being disruptive, and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life!",13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!",13,S06E13,6
SALESMAN,(angry) All you people with hair think you're so damn superior! You have no idea what it's like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? How'd you like to start your day with that?! (looks ready to punch Jerry),13,S06E13,6
JERRY,All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(leaps to feet) Jerry!,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,I'm sorry.,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,Please. (sits again),13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Hey Jerry, th... (spots George) George, you decided to get a rug! Good for you, Jack!",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,"Well, I'm, I'm just looking.",13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Oh. (to salesman) Uh, Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment.",13,S06E13,6
SALESMAN,I'll be right with you.,13,S06E13,6
GARY,"Listen, George, I got some bad news. I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.",13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,What?,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,What?,13,S06E13,6
GARY,This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you can't fight City Hall.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,"You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...",13,S06E13,6
GARY,(to George) You didn't?!,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,(admiring himself in mirror) I did.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct),13,S06E13,6
GARY,(indistinct) I'm not a hundred percent recovered yet!,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Gimme that thing!,13,S06E13,6
GEORGE,How's your life? All right?,13,S06E13,6
WOMAN,"Yeah, not bad at all.",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,"(at lectern) And now, uh, ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour)",13,S06E13,6
REPORTER,"So Jake, what's your percentage on this book?",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,"Oh, actually I, uh, I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know, uh, this is a co-venture and as...",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,(notices glasses) Where did you get those?,13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,"... as such, it...",13,S06E13,6
JAKE,"Those glasses, where did you get those glasses?",13,S06E13,6
LIPPMAN,(confused) Where... what?,13,S06E13,6
JAKE,(to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because it's not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those!,13,S06E13,6
ELAINE,(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.,13,S06E13,6
JERRY,Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,I know. I need a lesson.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You stink. You know you stink. What is this?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh. My ballet tickets.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Oh. Your ballet tickets.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"You know, I'm going as a beard.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,A beard?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Yes.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Why are you doing this?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Swan Lake, at the Met.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Yeah.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,I think he looks fantastic.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Oh, come on.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,You look ridiculous in that thing.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Well what about me?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,No I think he's got you beat buddy.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,So she's gorgeous.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Well have you got a picture?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,No.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Well, I have to see her.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Really?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. I think he will.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,It sounds like an excellent idea.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Here you go brother. Some food for you.,16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Now are you going to be here in an hour?,16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,Where am I going?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?",16,S06E16,6
LOU,Almond?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Pouty? I like that.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You can't go wrong with pouty.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,I'm excited about the pouty.,16,S06E16,6
LOU,All right I think that about does it.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"All right George, come on, take a look.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?",16,S06E16,6
LOU,"Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet her?",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Hey, man. Enjoy the food?",16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.",16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,I don't think so.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Woah, woah, that's mine.",16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,You gave it to me.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.",16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,You should have said something.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.,16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,I've really got to thank you for this.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.",16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.,16,S06E16,6
BOSS' WIFE,"So, um, you and Robert.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Yes indeed.,16,S06E16,6
BOSS,I'm surprised.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Really. Why?,16,S06E16,6
BOSS,No reason.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Oh, hi honey.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh it was such a great night.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,And did they suspect anything?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh it was such a great night. Oh.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You said that already.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh I did?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Yeah.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,He's incredible.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Yeah, but?",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I know.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,So?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,What?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Well it did occur to me.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Why? Is it irrevocable?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,We've got a good team.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Why can't he play for us?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,We just got along *so* great.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,I realize that.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Are you that desperate?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Yes I am.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,What are you looking for?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Tupperware.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,What about a plastic bag?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,You must be kidding.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,What is the difference?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, you talked to her.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Yeah well we go way back.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Why didn't anything happen between you two?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Who's to say it didn't?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Yes I did.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,What did you say to her?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,What do you think I said?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,I don't know.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,I told her the truth.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,As you see it?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Yes, as I see it.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,What hat?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"You know, you're little hair hat there.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,No.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Don't you think she could tell?,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,You only think that because you know me.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Have you noticed people staring at your head?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Look, I guarantee she won't know.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Oh, I'll split a cab with you.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.,16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,Hey that's my coffee!,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Hi Sarge.,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,"Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Sure. I will.,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.,16,S06E16,6
SPEAKER,"All of you, turn to the left.",16,S06E16,6
SPEAKER,The left.,16,S06E16,6
SPEAKER,Now turn to the right.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.",16,S06E16,6
DENISE,George?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.,16,S06E16,6
DENISE,Likewise. Have you been waiting long?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.",16,S06E16,6
DENISE,"Good, good.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,What's that?,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?",16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Really.,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,Have you ever seen the show?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,No.,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,I admit it. I don't watch it.,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,"Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,The poly?,16,S06E16,6
TIERNEY,Yeah. I think you've seen it.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Melrose Place?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Yes. Melrose Place.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,I just didn't know you watched that.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Well I do.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Why? Why were you so embarrassed?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,So what are you going to do?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh god this tastes terrible.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Did you shake it up?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,No.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You gotta shake it up.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,So tonight are you going to make the move?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I think I might.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,That's an interesting question.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,How so?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,What do you mean bald?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,She's bald?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,She's bald.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Oh come on.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Well maybe she got a haircut or something.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says ""Give me the Larry Fine.""",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Women go bald?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Hey.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Hey.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,You fixed me up with a bald woman.,16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Bald?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,So?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,No I'm not. I *was* bald.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Elaine.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"No, no, no Elaine.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Nooooo.,16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,"Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Well I figured that's what couples do.,16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,You almost convinced me we were a couple.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Well it was easy. Really.,16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,"Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?",16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,Upstairs?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Yeah. Upstairs?,16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,Elaine...,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?",16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,Changing teams?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Have you ever thought about it?,16,S06E16,6
ROBERT,But I'm a starting shortstop.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Good to have you back.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,She's as good as anybody else.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Going to need a little more coffee here.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"So George, how do I beat this lie detector?",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach me to sing like you.""",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Hey, I did it.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,What?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,I turned him. He defected.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said ""Too bad he's gay"".",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.",16,S06E16,6
LOU,What's your name?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Jerry Seinfeld.,16,S06E16,6
LOU,What is your address?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,129 West 81st street.,16,S06E16,6
LOU,Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,I don't know.,16,S06E16,6
LOU,Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,I don't know.,16,S06E16,6
LOU,"Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so, did she enjoy it?",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,I don't know.,16,S06E16,6
LOU,Did Jane sleep with Michael again?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,He went back? What do you mean he went back?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,He went back.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,You can't. That's why they lose very few players.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Well there's always a place for you, on our team.",16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,Okay.,16,S06E16,6
JERRY,Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.",16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,What is the matter?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,"I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?,16,S06E16,6
ELAINE,"I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.",16,S06E16,6
JERRY,"Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,"Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.",16,S06E16,6
MAN,I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup?,16,S06E16,6
HOMELESS MAN,"That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the, with the high hair. I'd recognize him anywhere.",16,S06E16,6
MAN,"Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.",16,S06E16,6
KRAMER,Me?,16,S06E16,6
GEORGE,Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,I would think.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Yeah? Would you do it?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Yes, I think I would.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,I have to go over to my grandmother's.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,What for?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"So, what, no lunch?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"No, we have time.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Oh. How's she doing?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Like toothpaste?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Ya-hah.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,There's a squeeze ketchup.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,I really don't see the difference.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,It's subtle.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,What?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Really?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(from a distance) Hey.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"No, I told you I admire your hearing.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE/JERRY/ELAINE/WENDY,Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.),17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"You're uh, physical therapist, right?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Yes.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(warning) George.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Have you tried heat and ice on it?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for you a little.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,(happy) Oh! Okay.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Let me give you my card.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Oh, thank you.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Bye Jerry.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Bye.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,What?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Why not?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Because, it is what she does.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"George, you got a little something, right here.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,Why?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,(regarding the menu) What're you getting?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,Yeah. Hah.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(to Kramer) ...Kramer.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Hello, boys and girls.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Speak of the devil.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,What for?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Why?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey, Carl!"" and he says ""Hey, Jerry!"" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.",17,S06E17,6
LEO,Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic squeeze containers?,17,S06E17,6
LEO,(traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hello, uncle Leo!",17,S06E17,6
LEO,What're you doing here?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.,17,S06E17,6
LEO,"Yeah, me too.",17,S06E17,6
NANA,Hello Jerry.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Hi Nana.,17,S06E17,6
LEO,Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.,17,S06E17,6
NANA,"Ha, well, here's the bottle.",17,S06E17,6
LEO,(grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.",17,S06E17,6
LEO,Give it to me.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Will you stop it.,17,S06E17,6
LEO,"Jerry, will you give me the bottle?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!,17,S06E17,6
NANA,You should let Buddy open it.,17,S06E17,6
LEO,Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.,17,S06E17,6
NANA,"Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?",17,S06E17,6
LEO,What fifty dollars?,17,S06E17,6
NANA,"Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and he gave you a hundred, and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister.",17,S06E17,6
LEO,"Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two.",17,S06E17,6
LEO,(laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your mother fifty dollars.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,I'm just not getting any hot water.,17,S06E17,6
JULIO,"Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your shower's not working. I'm gonna take care of it as soon as I can, Jerry.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Thanks, Julio.",17,S06E17,6
JULIO,Awright.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Huh?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,What's going on here?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Oh, I, I need a pen.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,What for?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,You got that straight.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"I told you, forget it.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,You're robbing me.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,Wha... W.. Are you going home?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Why?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, she'll be here any second.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.",17,S06E17,6
MORTY,Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years?,17,S06E17,6
HELEN,"Oh, Morty, please.",17,S06E17,6
MORTY,"Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And that's figuring conservatively at five percent interest, over fifty-three years, compounded quarterly. Or, if you put it into a ten-year T-bill...",17,S06E17,6
HELEN,"Morty, will you stop it!",17,S06E17,6
MORTY,"(determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Yeah?,17,S06E17,6
WENDY (O.C.),Wendy.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Come on up.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(indicating) That's her. That's her.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE/WENDY,Hi/Hey.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(muffled) Hi Wendy.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Oh, hi Jerry.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(muffled) Would you like something to drink?,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Sure.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(muffled) There you go.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,(taking the bottle) Ah.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"So, how's everything going?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other day, and then yesterday he cancelled on me.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hey! Jerry!,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"C'mon, that's not fair!",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,I told you I was gonna get it.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Oh, hello.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,(holds out her hand) Hi.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,(shaking hands) Yeah.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,(flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(hopeful) Oh, you were?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Well, I...",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Oh, well.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"(laughs, flattered) Oh, ho.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,You wanna go out with him?,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Well, why not?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"What, is there anything wrong with him?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Elaine?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,I'm just thinking about the question.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)",17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,(perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.",17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,"Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,What for?,17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,"Well, you cancelled on Tuesday, and our policy is ""twenty-four hours notice, for all cancellations"".",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,What's the problem?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.",17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,So. Will you be here tomorrow?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,...You can't put that picture up.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.",17,S06E17,6
STEVE,Hey Cosmo.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hey...,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"(interested) Well, how do you do?",17,S06E17,6
MARY,"Hello, (finds the right photo) Jerry.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.",17,S06E17,6
MARY,"You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(not really) Yeah.,17,S06E17,6
MARY,"Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh, sure, yeah.",17,S06E17,6
MARY,Thank you.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh, no!",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,What is so funny?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,Why?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.,17,S06E17,6
JOAN,Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(not as eager) Hi Joan.,17,S06E17,6
JOAN,How you doing?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Pretty good.,17,S06E17,6
JOAN,Just pretty good? Not great?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Okay, great.",17,S06E17,6
JOAN,Are you happy?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh, I'm delighted.",17,S06E17,6
JOAN,Okay. Have a nice day.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,You too.,17,S06E17,6
LOUISE,Hi Jerry.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hi, Louise.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hey.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Ah, well. Thank you very much!",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,For what?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Family?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.",17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,"Oh, hi. Mister Costanza, we were trying to get in touch with you. Wendy can't make her appointment.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,What d'you mean?,17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left a message on your machine. You didn't get it?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,When did you leave the message?,17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,Few hours ago.,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.",17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,"Look, Mister Costanza...",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Will that be cash, or cheque?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,I am really glad I took the day off.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Yeah. I hope my clients weren't too upset.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Ugh, the hell with 'em.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,What're you stopping here for?,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,I'm dropping you off.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Yeah, but if I take you to your door, then I have to go all the way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one way...",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, but it's only three blocks.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,Right. It's only three blocks.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says ""Well, this is as far as I can take you.""",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,You should have her work on it for you.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, alright, I gotta go.",17,S06E17,6
MAR,Hi Jerry.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Hi Mary.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.,17,S06E17,6
LOU,Hi Jerry.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Hi Louise...,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Hello.,17,S06E17,6
HELEN (V.O),Jerry?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?",17,S06E17,6
HELEN,"Well, he said no. He said we had no proof.",17,S06E17,6
MORTY,"No proof? We'll get him. He's a crook, sooner or later, he'll slip up.",17,S06E17,6
HELEN,"Uh, anyway, I want you to go check on Nana at the home.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Okay, I will.",17,S06E17,6
MORTY,"D'you realise, an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years...",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,What's up?,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Oh.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, look at this.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Look at my picture!,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,I've been defaced!,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.",17,S06E17,6
JACK,Hey. Hi Cosmo.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Hi Jack.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?",17,S06E17,6
JULIO,"Oh, I see. When you need something done, you're very friendly to people, huh?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(defensive) No no, that's not true!",17,S06E17,6
JULIO,"(accusing) Well, I think it is! It's a big building, Seinfeld, maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each other.",17,S06E17,6
NURSE,"Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.",17,S06E17,6
NURSE,"Well, she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to live next door to her.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Buddy?,17,S06E17,6
NURSE,"Yes, that's his name. He's right over there.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"(smiling) I'm sorry, I don't owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,A delicate genius?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Elaine?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(surprised) George!,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,(leaving) Hah. Good luck.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,What's going on?,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Oh sure. You have insurance, right?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,"Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,How did you hear that?,17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,I hear everything.,17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"I mean, why don't you two just take your business elsewhere, hmm?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.",17,S06E17,6
GEORGE,Yeah. Let's go.,17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.",17,S06E17,6
WENDY,"Why, what's wrong with my hair?",17,S06E17,6
ELAINE,"Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.",17,S06E17,6
RECEPTIONIST,She's right.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,So you were with him that day at the track?,17,S06E17,6
BUDDY,Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Leo?,17,S06E17,6
BUDDY,"Yeah, that's it. Leo. Ooh, what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash 'em in for the deposits, uh?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Is that so?,17,S06E17,6
BUDDY,"And, after your grandfather hit the daily double, he gave him a hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Well, that's very interesting.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.,17,S06E17,6
LEO,(defensive) One second...,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(with a triumphant point) You're busted!,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hey, Steve. How you doing?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Hey, Jeff. What's happening?",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!",17,S06E17,6
MARY,"(contemptuous) Look, why don't you do everybody a favour, and just get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody!",17,S06E17,6
JEFF,Hi Mary.,17,S06E17,6
MARY,Hi Jeff. How are you?,17,S06E17,6
MARY,Hi Pete. How you doing?,17,S06E17,6
PETE,"Hey, let's go get some coffee.",17,S06E17,6
JEFF,Great idea.,17,S06E17,6
MARY,"Oh, that'd be great.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hi.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Hey. Could I use your shower?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"What, again? You took one this morning.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.",17,S06E17,6
GUY,I'll go get some more beer.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.",17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hey.,17,S06E17,6
STEFANIE,Hi Cosmo.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Hi.,17,S06E17,6
STEFANIE,(kisses Kramer hello) Mmmwah.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Ooh, I like that.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,(impressed) Who's that?,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,Stefanie. 2-G.,17,S06E17,6
JERRY,Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.,17,S06E17,6
KRAMER,"Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.",17,S06E17,6
JERRY,"(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.",17,S06E17,6
DOORMAN,"Whoah, whoah, whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,(unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Oh. House-sitting, mmm.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Yeah.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"What're you, the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Can I just go up?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Oh, I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,How 'bout those Knicks?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Oh, I see. On the sports page...",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Yeah.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"...What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"So, you think your parents'll get back together?",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Hey, George, stick 'em up.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,What?,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,Why?,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Awright, hands up, porky!",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"Alright, that's enough.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,What guy?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(unhappy) I...,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,We'll still make the movie.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(accepting) Okay, okay.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"What'd you do today, dad?",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"Today, I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record, but I can't seem to find the hi-fi.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,I don't have a hi-fi.,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,Didn't I give you my old record player?,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,Cosmo? Who's Cosmo?,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,I'm Cosmo.,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"Well, I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"No, don't...",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(quietly) Give that to me.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?,18,S06E18,6
MR. PITT,"(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Alright, he just left. We can go.",18,S06E18,6
MR. PITT,(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.",18,S06E18,6
MR. PITT,I need to know what's in the mail.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.",18,S06E18,6
MR. PITT,"(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to know what's in the mail.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...",18,S06E18,6
MR. PITT (O.C.),"(piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover?",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Hey, buddy.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,You got a problem with that?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"(calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't you?!",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,My father opened his shirt...,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Yeah, and?",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,(matter of fact) He had breasts.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"What d'you mean, breasts?",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(waves his hands) Big breasts!,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,So what? A lot of older men have that.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"No, not these. These were real hooters.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"But, your father's not bald.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,You mean like a bra?,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.",18,S06E18,6
BUXOM WOMAN,"(indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey, we're twins.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(thinking she means the breasts) What!!,18,S06E18,6
BUXOM WOMAN,Our shirts. They're the same.,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"Oh, Huh, imagine that.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,What? Nothing.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Hey, did you make the movie?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,No.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Yes, we do.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,What is wrong with George?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,He's... trying to get something off his chest.,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,Help you?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't stab each other in the back, like people in your world.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,You wanna be friends?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,I'd like to be.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Then watch the door for a minute, would you?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,What?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Oh.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?",18,S06E18,6
MR. GREEN,"(indignant) Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years. Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,(after the guy) You think you're better than me?,18,S06E18,6
DELIVERY GUY,(indicating) You have to sign for it.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Oh, right.",18,S06E18,6
DELIVERY GUY,"(with a smile) Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"Thank you, Kramer.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,(indicating a chair) Put it over there.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"So, how you feeling?",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,Tired.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,Uh huh. Your back hurt?,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,How did you know?,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,You want me to wear a bra?!,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"No, no. A bra is for ladies.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Meet, the bro.",18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,"So, is your father excited about coming home?",18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,George?,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?,18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.",18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,She was a lovely woman.,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,Yuh. What about physically?,18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,Physically?,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?",18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,"Well, you've seen pictures.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.,18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,So what?,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?",18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,"Big? No, just my height.",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,Bosomy?,18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.",18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,Where do you get your genes from?!,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,I can't believe you left your post.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,He left me there. You see the mind games?,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?",18,S06E18,6
TENANT 1,Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby.,18,S06E18,6
TENANT 2,Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Yeah.,18,S06E18,6
ESTELLE,"(shocked) Oh, my god!",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,What were you doing watching the door anyway?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,He asked me to. We were getting along.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Alright, well what if we say...",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,I came to pick you up.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,Yeah. That's what I just said.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,I know. I was just...,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,"Alright, well. Just, start again, then.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Okay, you came to pick me up at...",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Right.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,You see? Again.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,What? I said right.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,But I don't know if this is gonna work.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!",18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Okay.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,Good. Now fix me a drink.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,How's that feel?,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,This feels very comfortable.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,You see?,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,I feel ten years younger.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"And I can breathe easier, too.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,Of course. Sid Farkus. He's the best in the business.,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,Let's do it!,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"Except, we gotta do something about the name.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Why, what's wrong with bro?",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"No, bro's no good. Too ethnic.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Alright, you got something better?",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,How 'bout uh... the mansiere?,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,Mansiere?,18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"That's right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere, get it?",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"Hey George, what d'you like better? The bro, or the mansiere?",18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,Dad. We need to talk.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"I had to use the bathroom, so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes.",18,S06E18,6
MRS. PAYTON,Why should I believe you?,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,"(indicating Elaine) Actually, it was her friend.",18,S06E18,6
MRS. PAYTON,"I was just speaking to the doorman here, about the couch robbery.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?",18,S06E18,6
MRS. PAYTON,He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen.,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,Is it possible we were victims of a sting?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN 2,"So, you didn't even (indistinct) watch the couch?",18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN,No. I was just messing with his head.,18,S06E18,6
DOORMAN 2,And they think they're better than us?,18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,"Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,We have to replace the couch.,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,Now we have to buy a new couch?!,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?,18,S06E18,6
JERRY,The one with the Poppie stain?!,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,But it's got a pee-stain on it.,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,"No, the cushion's turned over.",18,S06E18,6
ELAINE,(not sure) I guess.,18,S06E18,6
GEORGE,(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!,18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Now, it's called the bro.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,"Or, the mansiere.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but I prefer the bro.",18,S06E18,6
FRANK,I like mansiere.,18,S06E18,6
FARKUS,"Well, I have to tell you, it's a very interesting idea.",18,S06E18,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,18,S06E18,6

JERRY,Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around),20,S06E20,6
NEWMAN,"So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor.",20,S06E20,6
JERRY,"You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....",20,S06E20,6

ELAINE,Oh! boy.,20,S06E20,6
KRAMER,"You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.",20,S06E20,6

ELAINE,"Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.",20,S06E20,6
MORTY,Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it?,20,S06E20,6

[Opening Scene,"Jerry and Elaine are outside, heading towards the apartment building]",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,I hear you're going out with David Putty.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Yeah. What, is it a problem?",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, god.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,All right.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"So, I'm getting an eye job.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Georgie, I'm a divorcee.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Well, I'm out there, George.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"No, you're not out there.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"I am, too!",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Well, anyway, the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because I'll be all drugged up.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,This is the only time the doctor *has*.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Hi, little buddy.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Come on over and sit down.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"So, Kramer. I'm getting an eye job.",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,She's not out there!,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"So, who is your doctor?",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Uh, Bakersoll.",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Tuesday? Uh...,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Oh, I don't care.",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Well, giddy-up!",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.",21,S06E21,6
CLERK,Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,All righty...,21,S06E21,6
CLERK,"Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.",21,S06E21,6
CLERK,What's your name again?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Cosmo Kramer.,21,S06E21,6
CLERK,(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,No! I'm not the Assman.,21,S06E21,6
CLERK,"Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,How do you feel?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Fine.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Something the matter?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,No.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Then what is it?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"No, nothing.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Hi.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,I was with David *Putty* last night.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Yeah, so.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,He did the move.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,What move?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,You know...*the* move.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Wait a second. *My* move?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,David Putty used *my* move?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Yes, yes.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Are you sure?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Well, wait---wait a second.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,What?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Isn't that a little...rash?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,No! He stole my move!,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, but...*I* like the move.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Can I just get it opened first?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,You feel better?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Nancy Klopper?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,You're gonna tell me...or not.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,I got a headboard.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Is it padded?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,No.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Good. How tall is she?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Five-foot four. Why?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.",21,S06E21,6
[Back at Jerry's apartment,"Jerry and George have just walked in, still conversing on the same subject]",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Is it a clockwise swirl?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,What is it?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,When did you do this?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Oh... Why Fusilli?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Well, thank you very much.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"So, did you get your new plates?",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,What do they say?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Assman.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Assman?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Yeah. Proctologist.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way ""It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.""",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves),21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Hey, David.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"Oh, hi, Jerry.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,What move?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Swirl.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Whatever. I don't even do it.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"Yeah, that's right.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, you take *that* out of town.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Fine.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Good!,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,"Ow, George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doing?",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.",21,S06E21,6
NANCY,"Well, stop it!",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,You don't like the move?,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,No. I don't.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,You're kidding.,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,"No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"No, I'm sorry.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,What?!!,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,I can't do the move.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,What?,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"Oh, he's ruined it for me.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, oh, come on, please?",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, so---so that's it?",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,I'll come up with some new stuff.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for."" (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).",21,S06E21,6
DR. BAKERSOLL,I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Oh, okay.",21,S06E21,6
DR. BAKERSOLL,"Now, is someone coming to pick you up?",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute.",21,S06E21,6
SECURITY GUARD,Can I help you?,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.",21,S06E21,6
SECURITY GUARD,"Oh, oh, okay. Sure...",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Thanks. Have a good day.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,I just can't get over how fantastic you look.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Oh, really?",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Did he say ""Assman""?",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Oh my goodness.,21,S06E21,6
(Another car passes,"""Hey, the Assman's in town!"")",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,You got that straight!,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Supposed to close with the swirl?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Yeah?,21,S06E21,6
BUZZER,Elaine.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Except that it's not Putty.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,What happened to Putty?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. ""By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there."" ""Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.""",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Hey, Elaine.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, hello.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Is it something I said?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Really?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,What is it?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Huh.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,I think that's mine.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,I'm not surprised.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Why?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Fusilli Jerry?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Yeah. Kramer made it.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Hey, Assman!",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Hey, well, this is Sally.",21,S06E21,6
SALLY,Hello.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Hi.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Hi.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Shall we go?,21,S06E21,6
SALLY,Okay. (turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing of her hips),21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out with a dumbbell yesterday. I feel *vigorous*.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"I got things to do, too.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Don't upset me! I can't cry!,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me.",21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Hey, let me ask you a question.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Sure.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,What do you charge for blown shocks?,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,What?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Two, three hundred?",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,I don't know. Maybe five hundred.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Ah.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,What about a bad gasket?,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Bad gasket?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,What is all this?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.",21,S06E21,6
DAVID,What kind of car is it?,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,"All together, that could run about sixteen hundred.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Oh.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Is that with the parts and labor?,21,S06E21,6
DAVID,Uh-huh.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Hmm.,21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,"Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....",21,S06E21,6
NANCY,Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,It just came to me.,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,You mean in the end?,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,Uh-huh.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,A counter-clockwise swirl.,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,What's that?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,What?,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,Give me that. (grabs his hand) I wanna see what's on your hand.,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,"Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've got crib notes?!!",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.,21,S06E21,6
NANCY,"Oh, my god, you're sick. (gets out of bed)",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!",21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"Assman? I'll get him, Assman!",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,So what are you going to do?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?",21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Where's your friend Kramer?,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,I don't know. Why?,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,What do you mean?,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't know what that's about? That's my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short.",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Really, stopping short. That's a good move.",21,S06E21,6
FRANK,You're not kidding it's a good move!,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Hey.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Hey.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Hey, Frank.",21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short with my wife!,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.",21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split the profits on the Manssierre with you.",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Bro.,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Manssierre!,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,Bro!,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Manssierre! You...!,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Aah!!!,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"Oh, my god!",21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.",21,S06E21,6
ELAINE,Me either.,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,They say this guy's the best.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,He had to use cork-screw pasta.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.",21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,The name on the boat. Look at it.,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,Assman!,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!",21,S06E21,6
DOCTOR,Which one is the son?,21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,(stands up) I am.,21,S06E21,6
DOCTOR,Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that this won't take long. And he's going to be fine.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?",21,S06E21,6
DR. COOPERMAN,Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau to straighten it out.,21,S06E21,6
KRAMER,So...you're the Assman.,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! I've been waiting for hours!,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,I fell on some Fusilli.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Fusilli?,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,"You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It got stuck in me. Had to go to the proctologist.",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,The proctologist? Are you okay?,21,S06E21,6
FRANK,Yeah.,21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Oh, I was so worried. (grabs a couple of tissues from the box)",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Ma, don't cry!",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,"Oh, I can't help it!",21,S06E21,6
GEORGE,"Ma, your eyes!",21,S06E21,6
ESTELLE,Oh!,21,S06E21,6
JERRY,"What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)",22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,Is that the supermodel?,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,"Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.",22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,I thought you had a show in Ithaca.,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,"I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.",22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,"Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.",22,S06E22,6
JERRY,So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.,22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,I've had enough. I am marchin' in.,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,You're marchin' in.,22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,I'm marchin'. (Enter George),22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,Hey.,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,Hey. Elaine's quitting.,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,Really?,22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,I'm marchin' in.,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,How 'bout the march out?,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.,22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,This is it. Wish me luck.,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits),22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,"Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.",22,S06E22,6
JERRY,Why?,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,"Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.",22,S06E22,6
JERRY,What for?,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,"They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.",22,S06E22,6
JERRY,Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,It better be.,22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,"Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.",22,S06E22,6
PITT,One second Elaine.,22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,Mr. Pitt...,22,S06E22,6
PITT,"Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will to include you as a beneficiary.",22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,What?,22,S06E22,6
PITT,"Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care of after I'm gone.",22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...,22,S06E22,6
PITT,"(Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?",22,S06E22,6
ELAINE,"Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,",22,S06E22,6
PITT,"Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist.",22,S06E22,6

JERRY,"Yes, I know. I've flown before.",22,S06E22,6
KATE,Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?,22,S06E22,6
JERRY,No.,22,S06E22,6

JERRY,What?,22,S06E22,6
FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you.",22,S06E22,6
KATE,"I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there.",22,S06E22,6

FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane.",22,S06E22,6

CARL,Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?,22,S06E22,6

WAITER,"Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house.",22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!,22,S06E22,6
GEORGE,"Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?",23,S06E23,6
SIENA,That's true. There really has been no development in toilet paper.,23,S06E23,6

JERRY,"He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, ""Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!""?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?",23,S06E23,6

ELAINE,Colors.,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,What?,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Fifty-fifty.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"What, you never said it?",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, so it wasn't a total loss.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Hey.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"What about you, George?",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"So, so.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Sure, fine with me.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,So she works at the zoo?,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,So how long have you been a Devils' fan?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"(off camera) Since I was a kid, I'm from Jersey.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Hey, no way, man.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Yes.,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,We're primed.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,What the--,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,So what do you think?,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,What is that?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,I painted my face.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,(still in disbelief) You painted your face?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,Yeah.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Why?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"You know, support the team.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Well, you can't walk around like that.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,Why not?,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Because it's insane?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Hey, you gotta let them know you're out there, this is the playoffs.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Hey.,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,Hey.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Dave, um, painted his face.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Ok, ready to go?",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Yeah.,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,(startlingly loud) LET'S GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Let's go Devils!!,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"You're dead, Messier! We're gonna get you, Messier!",23,S06E23,6
FAN #1,Will you sit down?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Hey man, I'm just trying to support the team.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Oh yeah, because you're a Ranger fan and you know I'm messing with their heads.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,Go Devils!!,23,S06E23,6
RADIO ANNOUNCER,Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take-- (George turns down the volume),23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"You know, I could have actually gone to that.",23,S06E23,6
SIENA,So why didn't you?,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Well, I didn't want to break our date.",23,S06E23,6
SIENA,"Oh, well.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Because I... I love you.,23,S06E23,6
SIENA,"You know, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldn't get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive, we didn't let you penetrate!",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"(pounding the hood) Hey, what are you doing?! Watch where you're driving, man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Don't mess with the Devils, buddy. We're number one, we beat anybody! We're the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!!",23,S06E23,6
FATHER HERNANDEZ,El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!!,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.""",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Yup.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Big matzoh ball.,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Huge matzoh ball.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Those damn 'I love you' returns.,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Well, it's all over. I slipped up.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Oh, you don't know.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, ""I love you"", and the other says, ""I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."".",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Unless you're married.,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"No, people hate that.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Ideally.,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.,23,S06E23,6
WAITRESS,Matzoh ball soup?,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,That'd be me.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,No question about it.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,At the zoo?,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Well, he started it!",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"It's a monkey, Kramer!",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, I still think it's wrong.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,I'm not taking anyone's side.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,No.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Ah, you're out of your mind.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, where you going?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Who died?,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,So he actually had it?,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,The one Puddy screamed at in the car?,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Gotta support the team.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,You know I really hate my clothes.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Hm.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"I open up my closet, there's just nothing.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Hm.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Hm.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?,23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,"Ah, Mr. Kramer?",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Yes.,23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,Thanks for coming.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"So, uh, what did you want to see me about?",23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,"Well, Mr. Kramer, to get right to it, we're having a bit of a problem with Barry.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Barry?,23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,The chimpanzee.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?",23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,"Well, he's not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. He's lost his appetite. He's even curtailed his autoerotic activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"So, so what do you want me to do?",23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,"Well, frankly we'd like you to apologize.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, well he started it.",23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,"Mr. Kramer, he is an innocent primate.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--",23,S06E23,6
SIENA,"Hey, that's ok. Well, I've gotta go feed the marmosets.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.",23,S06E23,6
MR. PLESS,She doesn't hear too well out of her left ear.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Oh.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Yeah.,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Hey, they can't go, ""Hey! You look fabulous!""",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Hey.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Girlfriend, yeah, right.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Barry?,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,The monkey.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Well?,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,What?,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Oh my god.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,What?,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,Are you gonna say it again?,23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"That's the question, Jimmy.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,I'm gonna do it.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,What's going on?,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,He's gonna talk into her other ear.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Yeah, I saw him.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, not exactly.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,I don't know if he's mad.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Alright, so what happened when you saw him?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Uh huh.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Look, what do you want me to do?",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"No. No, I can't!",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"You stubborn, stupid, silly man!",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Hey, great dip. You made this?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"No, it's from the store.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"David? David, I think we aught to talk.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Alright, that's cool.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"You gotta be kidding, how come?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, but you like the face painting.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Well, I don't need to do it. It's not like a habit or anything.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Yeah, that's right.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"That's so, that's so sweet.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Ah, c'mere. (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game. I'll be back, we'll make out.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,"Siena, I love you.",23,S06E23,6
SIENA,"Yeah, I know. I heard you the first time.",23,S06E23,6
GEORGE,Yeah. Just confirming.,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,What is that?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,That's the letter 'D'.,23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Well, I'm going to the game tonight, and me and these five other guys are gonna take our shirts off and spell out 'Devils'.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,But you said no more painting.,23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"No, I said no more face painting, and as you can see this is not my face.",23,S06E23,6
ELAINE,"Yeah, that's right.",23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,Well? Did he call?,23,S06E23,6
JERRY,No.,23,S06E23,6
KRAMER,"Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?",23,S06E23,6
ALEC,"What can I do for you, Jerry?",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.",23,S06E23,6
ALEC,"I wish you'd called me earlier, I could have given you my tickets for tonight.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"Oh, you already gave them away?",23,S06E23,6
ALEC,"Yeah, but you know what? I have a friend, he's got a couple of seats. If you don't mind the nose bleed section, they're yours.",23,S06E23,6
JERRY,"No, we don't care, we just want to go.",23,S06E23,6
ALEC,"There is one little catch, though.",23,S06E23,6
PUDDY,"Hey, great game, huh?",23,S06E23,6
PRIEST,Father Hernandez?,23,S06E23,6
FATHER HERNANDEZ,Huh?,23,S06E23,6

FATHER HERNANDEZ,Oh. La Madonna! Madre de Christo! Yo estoy lista!,23,S06E23,6
GENNICE,(Crying) (sob sob),24,S06E24,6
JERRY,"(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.",24,S06E24,6
JERRY,"She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?",24,S06E24,6
GEORGE,Where were you?,24,S06E24,6
JERRY,I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.,24,S06E24,6
GEORGE,"Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.",24,S06E24,6
JERRY,Of course.,24,S06E24,6
GEORGE,"When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.",24,S06E24,6
JERRY,"yeah,",24,S06E24,6
KRAMER,Hey.,24,S06E24,6
GEORGE,Hey. I gotta go.,24,S06E24,6
KRAMER,Where you going?,24,S06E24,6
JERRY,"The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical.",24,S06E24,6

FRANK,I had an affair with a Korean woman.,24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,"Uh, Mr. Costanza, I",24,S06E24,6
FRANK,"No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me.",24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,"Mr. Costanza, I,",24,S06E24,6
FRANK,"Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, "" eno enoa juang "". Which means, ""this guy - this is not my kind of guy"".",24,S06E24,6

KRAMER,SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.,24,S06E24,6
KRAMER,"So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know.

My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)",24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,"Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.",24,S06E24,6

RUBY,"""That's the least of his problems.""",24,S06E24,6
FRANK,What was that?,24,S06E24,6

FRANK,"Okay, THAT'S IT! ""oki on awa"" Where's my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve.",24,S06E24,6
KIM,That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight.,24,S06E24,6
LOTUS,That man also refuses to take his shoes off.,24,S06E24,6
FRANK,(from other room) I never seen people treated like this!,24,S06E24,6
RUBY,You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out!,24,S06E24,6

BETTE,Get me one of those Black and White cookies.,24,S06E24,6
KRAMER,"yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.",24,S06E24,6
BETTE,Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not going to be very pleasant to be around.,24,S06E24,6
KRAMER,Now that's impossible.,24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.,24,S06E24,6
PETERMAN,That's the best way to get someplace you've never been.,24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,"yes, (sob) I suppose,",24,S06E24,6
PETERMAN,Have you been crying?,24,S06E24,6

GENNICE,"Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed.  YOU CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. You see that? You see what I am going through?",24,S06E24,6
GEORGE,So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.,24,S06E24,6
JERRY,"Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.",24,S06E24,6
GENNICE,I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) Nobody in the show will even talk to me.,24,S06E24,6
JERRY,Stop your crying will ya?,24,S06E24,6
GENNICE,What?,24,S06E24,6
GEORGE,You heard him.,24,S06E24,6
GENNICE,"Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened.",24,S06E24,6

PETERMAN,Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00.,24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,"Oh, that's not too expensive.",24,S06E24,6
PETERMAN,That shirt. Where did you get it?,24,S06E24,6
ELAINE,"Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.",24,S06E24,6
PETERMAN,That's NOT bad!,24,S06E24,6
KIM,"Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off.",24,S06E24,6
FRANK,I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem.,24,S06E24,6
KIM,I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.,24,S06E24,6
FRANK,I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your father had to make a federal case out of it.,24,S06E24,6
KIM,Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us.,24,S06E24,6
FRANK,Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal.,24,S06E24,6
KIM,You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again.,24,S06E24,6

NEWMAN,I knew you'd back out.,1,S07E01,7
ELAINE,"KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?",1,S07E01,7
KRAMER,"Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.",1,S07E01,7

JERRY,Sorry!,1,S07E01,7
ELAINE,What? What?,1,S07E01,7

ELAINE,"Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!",1,S07E01,7

COP,You're under arrest.,1,S07E01,7
KRAMER,Arrest?,1,S07E01,7
COP,I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so compressed it completely collapsed the right side..,1,S07E01,7
JERRY,Newman.,1,S07E01,7
NEWMAN,What took you so long?,1,S07E01,7
KRAMER,"Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?",1,S07E01,7
NEWMAN,"Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch.",1,S07E01,7

JERRY,Isn't he the one with the show on cable?,2,S07E02,7

ELAINE,He's in.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,What's to discuss?,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Come on! GEORGE is getting married!,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,Is he happy?,2,S07E02,7
[At the restaurant! GEORGE,is coming from the bathroom to sit with his bride-to-be.],2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?,2,S07E02,7
SUSAN,"Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?,2,S07E02,7
SUSAN,"Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.,2,S07E02,7
SUSAN,"Can we change the subject, please?",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?,2,S07E02,7
SUSAN,"No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.,2,S07E02,7
SUSAN,"Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.,2,S07E02,7

ELAINE,"Oh, dear.",2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,"It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?",2,S07E02,7

GEORGE,"Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Hmm.,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, ""Can we change the subject?""",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"See, now that I don't care for.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,It should resolve of its own volition.,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"That's exactly what I said, except I used the word ""momentum"".",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Momentum - same thing.,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Yeah, I know.",2,S07E02,7

JERRY,You're turning.,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"If you need more time, you should have more time.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"What, you think I could postpone it?",2,S07E02,7

GEORGE,"You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.",2,S07E02,7

ELAINE,I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .",2,S07E02,7
RABBI,How wonderful.,2,S07E02,7

GEORGE,I didn't have make-up sex.,2,S07E02,7

RABBI,"Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Really?,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,She came off as pretty desperate.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,I didn't know any of this.,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Hum, well it all comes as news to me.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,(enters) Hi.,2,S07E02,7

ELAINE,He told you about our conversation?,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,We had quite a little chat.,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,He told you about . . .,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,He told you all that? How could he?,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,Can he do that?,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,He did it.,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,That's what's so fascinating.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,Why not?,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,Well that's stupid,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,That's the rule.,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,"Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.",2,S07E02,7
RABBI,"Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,Yeah,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?",2,S07E02,7
RABBI,Was that a problem for you?,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?",2,S07E02,7
RABBI,"Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,Mrs. Winston?,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,"Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going ""to happen"" for you.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,Don Ramsey?,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.",2,S07E02,7

USHER,Here you go.,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,Ow,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"You didn't say this to George, did you?",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Yeah that! So, . . .",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,Hey oh.,2,S07E02,7

GEORGE,"Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Well, I guess I'm getting older.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,Yeah.,2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"My most, just heartfelt congratulations.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.",2,S07E02,7
ELAINE,"Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,"Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh",2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,Nope. I wept like a baby.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,What?,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,You cried?,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,"I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.",2,S07E02,7
"JERRY, GEORGE, & KRAMER",Hey!,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,"Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.",2,S07E02,7
JERRY,Suing? What for?,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,The coffee was too hot.,2,S07E02,7
JERRY,It's supposed to be hot.,2,S07E02,7
KRAMER,Not THAT hot.,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,(On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.,2,S07E02,7
GEORGE,Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.,2,S07E02,7
RABBI,"A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.",2,S07E02,7
[Setting,Booth at Monk's Cafe],3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.",3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,"I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.",3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"Ya know, I was just a little surprised.",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,What about all the loser stuff?,3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,"I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said ""I've never seen you looser"".",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,"I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.",3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Where you going?,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,I'm going shopping with Susan.,3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,What kind of shopping?,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,Clothes shopping.,3,S07E03,7

JACKIE,"Half milk, half coffee?",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,Hm Hm. You take a sip?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Yes I did.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,"Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion?",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,"Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Well I think I take a normal sip.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.",3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,"Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?",3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,"Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,It's definitely preposterous.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,So. Then what happened?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,Was there a top on it?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,No. They put the top on.,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?,3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Ah No no, I haven't.",3,S07E03,7
JACKIE,(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.,3,S07E03,7

JACKIE,Jackie.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?",3,S07E03,7

GEORGE,All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.,3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,Name one.,3,S07E03,7
MR ROSS,"So, you find anything?",3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,"Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.",3,S07E03,7

SUSAN,What?,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,The security guard.,3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,What about him?,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,Why does he have to stand?,3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,Because he's a security guard.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.,3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,"George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.",3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,Aren't you concerned about the security guard?,3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,Not really. (Walks away),3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.,3,S07E03,7
SUSAN,All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think?,3,S07E03,7

ELAINE,Nothing.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,"I know nothing, but what did you actually do?",3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Wow. That really is nothing.,3,S07E03,7

JERRY,"Oh yeah, how's that looking?",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.",3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Oh I can be quite litigious.,3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.,3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.,3,S07E03,7

MAESTRO,I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed to be great stuff. It's all herbal.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?",3,S07E03,7
MAESTRO,It's nothing.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.",3,S07E03,7
MAESTRO,"Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.",3,S07E03,7

MAESTRO,Ciao.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,"Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,That's right.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Why?,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Because it's a stupid thing to be called.,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Jerry he's a conductor.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.,3,S07E03,7

JERRY,Yeah.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,Too flashy?,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,"Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?",3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,(Obviously lying) No.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,No.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Are you sensing anything right now?,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,"Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.",3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.,3,S07E03,7

KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.",3,S07E03,7
JERRY,Why are they settling?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Cause their afraid of bad publicity.,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?,3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,Yeah that's right.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!,3,S07E03,7

MAESTRO,Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.,3,S07E03,7
MAESTRO,"You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro.",3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,Excuse me?,3,S07E03,7
MAESTRO,"Well, ya know I am a conductor.",3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, so?",3,S07E03,7
MAESTRO,Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.,3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,"Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.",3,S07E03,7
MAESTRO,"I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said ""Hello Maestro, how about a beer"". O.K. So that's a fact.",3,S07E03,7
ELAINE,Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing),3,S07E03,7

GUARD,I don't need a chair.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?",3,S07E03,7
GUARD,Nope.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,Would you like a chair?,3,S07E03,7
GUARD,I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.,3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,"Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?",3,S07E03,7
GUARD,"Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.",3,S07E03,7
GEORGE,That's exactly my point.,3,S07E03,7
GUARD,Well who wouldn't?,3,S07E03,7

GEORGE,Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?,3,S07E03,7
JERRY,I have no idea.,3,S07E03,7

JERRY,"Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?",3,S07E03,7
KRAMER,"Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.",3,S07E03,7

JERRY,"Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.",4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.,4,S07E04,7
JERRY,I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.,4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,"Ah, . . .",4,S07E04,7
GEORGE,Now you're off on a topic.,4,S07E04,7
JERRY,"You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.",4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,Uh hu.,4,S07E04,7
JERRY,Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.,4,S07E04,7
GEORGE,You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.,4,S07E04,7

ELAINE,Right there. Right there. You just did it again.,4,S07E04,7
GEORGE,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.,4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,You're eye still hurts?,4,S07E04,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.",4,S07E04,7

KRAMER,"No, of course not. (winks back)",4,S07E04,7
KRAMER,"You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.",4,S07E04,7

JERRY,Why were dogs chasing you?,4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.,4,S07E04,7

GEORGE,. . . gone?,4,S07E04,7
JERRY,It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.,4,S07E04,7

ELAINE,"Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.",4,S07E04,7
GEORGE,Napkins?,4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,"I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.",4,S07E04,7

KRAMER,"Yeah, well, no good?",4,S07E04,7
O'NEILL,Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from?,4,S07E04,7
KRAMER,Two is better than one.,4,S07E04,7
O'NEILL,"That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter.",4,S07E04,7
KRAMER,"Well, Babe Ruth did it.",4,S07E04,7
O'NEILL,He did not.,4,S07E04,7
KRAMER,"Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?",4,S07E04,7
O'NEILL,I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two.,4,S07E04,7
KRAMER,"Well, maybe I did overextend myself.",4,S07E04,7
O'NEILL,How the heck did you get in here anyway?,4,S07E04,7
JAMES,"(on phone) Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 630 clients because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas!",4,S07E04,7

HOLLY,Then who did?,4,S07E04,7
ELAINE,Ask Jerry.,4,S07E04,7

ELAINE,uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?,5,S07E05,7

JEAN-PAUL,What are you saying?,5,S07E05,7
JERRY,"I'm saying ""get the hell outta there""! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!",5,S07E05,7

JERRY,"Frankly, I'm a little concerned.",5,S07E05,7
ELAINE,"Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my...

GEORGE,"Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...",5,S07E05,7
STEINBRENNER,"Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax. I've got two words to say to you, George hot tub. (George looks at him, puzzled)",5,S07E05,7
JERRY,"I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!",5,S07E05,7
ELAINE,"Then how did she find out, Jerry?!",5,S07E05,7
JERRY,Maybe you should check with the rabbi.,5,S07E05,7
KRAMER,(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?,5,S07E05,7
ELAINE,"Oh no, thank you.",5,S07E05,7

STEINBRENNER,"How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone. Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver. Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me. You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single man, George?",5,S07E05,7
GEORGE,"(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...",5,S07E05,7
STEINBRENNER,"I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs) She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show, about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he liked me very much, you know.",5,S07E05,7
GEORGE,"All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.",6,S07E06,7

JERRY,"Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Hey.,6,S07E06,7

ELAINE,What soup place?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Stunned by soup?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Huh. All right. Come on.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Why? What happens if you don't order right?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,He yells and you don't get your soup.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,What?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,What?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,The main thing is to keep the line moving.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Oh, boy, I'm really scared!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Elaine.,6,S07E06,7

JERRY,What about the soup?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,[in French accent] Pardon.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,This line is huge.,6,S07E06,7

JERRY,"Oh, no. It is. Just be still.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.,6,S07E06,7
BANIA,"Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.",6,S07E06,7

JERRY,"Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.",6,S07E06,7
BANIA,Why not?,6,S07E06,7

JERRY,"Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,I gave you a taste. What do you want?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Why can't we share?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!",6,S07E06,7

GEORGE,"Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,Hi. Hi shmoopy.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Hi shmoopy.,6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,"No, you're a shmoopy!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,You're a shmoopy!,6,S07E06,7

JERRY,"Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Why?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,I just don't feel like it anymore.,6,S07E06,7

JERRY,"Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Do you need anything?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Mulligatawny?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,All right. I'll be back.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.,6,S07E06,7

GEORGE,No. I didn't get it.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Why? What happened?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,I made a mistake.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,[laughing],6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Oh, I know! It is awful!",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Why do they have to do that in front of people?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,I don't know.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,What is that with the shmoopy?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Ohh!,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Ohh! Stop it! I know.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Ugh!,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"You know, we should say something.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"You know, we absolutely should.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,I still haven't figured him out.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,No. Me neither.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.,6,S07E06,7

SOUP NAZI,Yes.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, "" Scent Of A Woman."" Who-ah! Who-ah!",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Very good. Very good.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Well, I --",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,You know something?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Hmmm?,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,No soup for you!,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,What?,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Come back one year! Next!,6,S07E06,7

KRAMER,Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?,6,S07E06,7
BOB,What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.,6,S07E06,7
BOB,"Look, you wanna get hurt?",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Huh?,6,S07E06,7
BOB,"I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can hurt you. Now, just back off.",6,S07E06,7
RAY,Bob.,6,S07E06,7
BOB,Just pick it up.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"What is this, huh?",6,S07E06,7
BOB,You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding? We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Well, b -- it was stolen.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Wha--?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"These street toughs, they robbed me.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Street toughs took my armoire?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,I can't believe this!,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Well, where's the soup?",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Oh...yeah!,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,What are you gonna get?,6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,I'll decide at the last minute.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Uh-oh.,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,"Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,I can kiss anywhere I want to.,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,You just cost yourself a soup!,6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,"How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Do I know you?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,It was a bisque.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Really?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Have you tastes the soup?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Hey.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Hey.,6,S07E06,7

ELAINE,"Yeah. I know. Me, too.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"So, did these thieves want any money?",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,No.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,They just wanted the armoire?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Yeah?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Hup! Hup!,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,No. In what way?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Hello.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Hello.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Hey.,6,S07E06,7

KRAMER,"All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,One of these days that guy is gonna get his.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"So, how was the movie?",6,S07E06,7

GEORGE,"Oh, yeah?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Happy? Why should I be happy?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"I don't know, but you look like you're happy.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Why should I care?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Is that so?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Disgusting?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,People who do that should be arrested.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,What?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,You shook my hand in that coffee shop.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,You're still with the pact?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Mmm-hmm. You reneged.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,All I did was shake your hand.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Ah-ha!,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Ohh! This city.,6,S07E06,7
NEWMAN,"One large jambalaya, please.",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,"So, continue.",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.",6,S07E06,7
NEWMAN,Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,"All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome to it. So, take it, it's yours.",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,How can I possibly thank you?,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,You are the only one who understands me.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,You suffer for your soup.,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Yes. That is right.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,How can I tolerate any less from my customer?,6,S07E06,7
CUSTOMER,"Uh, gazpacho, por favor.",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Por favor?,6,S07E06,7
CUSTOMER,"Um, I'm part Spanish.",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Adios muchacho!,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Git.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,It was stupid of me.,6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,"Well, it was very insulting.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.,6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,"Well, behind every joke there's some truth.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says "" Aw, I'll just have some coffee."" There's no truth to that.",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,"Well, I guess you're right.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,"Yes, shmoopy.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Aw!,6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"Hey, Jerry!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Oh, yes. Hello.",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,Hello. Won't you join us?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"No, thanks.",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,Of course.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Well, we're changing the rules.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Ahh. Good for you.,6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"Aw, what are you getting George?",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"Oh, George, you're so sweet.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,Aww!,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?",6,S07E06,7
SHEILA,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Yum yum little tuna fishy?,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Come here.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,And..voila!,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,[gasps],6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,The K Man did it!,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah!,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,How 'bout zero?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,What?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Get out!,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,The Soup Nazi gave it to you?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Why?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,[gasps],6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Yeah. Well, he's a dear.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,How much tip do you leave on $8.15?,6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Huh?,6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?,6,S07E06,7
CUSTOMER,How is he today?,6,S07E06,7
BANIA,I think he's in a good mood.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,"You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,I'm heading over to Elaine's.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Those two?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Are you sure?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Yeah. That's them.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Well, let's confront 'em.",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,No!,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Let's go.,6,S07E06,7
BOB,"Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.",6,S07E06,7
RAY,"Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.",6,S07E06,7
BOB,"Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,Excuse me.,6,S07E06,7
RAY,Are you talking to me?,6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Uh, well, uh, we --",6,S07E06,7
RAY,"I said, are you talking to me?",6,S07E06,7
BOB,"Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!",6,S07E06,7
KRAMER,"Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...""",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!",6,S07E06,7
JERY,So?,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,What do you care?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Get out of my way, Jerry.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Elaine, let the man make his soup!",6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey?",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,"Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.",6,S07E06,7

SUSAN,"Hi, Jerry.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Hey, Susan, George.",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"You know, I really like Sheila a lot.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Oh, really?",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.,6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,"Oh, no! That's too bad.",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Really?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.",6,S07E06,7
SUSAN,Mmm-hmm.,6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,You did?,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.",6,S07E06,7
GEORGE,Yeah. See ya.,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Go on! Leave! Get out!,6,S07E06,7
WOMAN,But I didn't do anything.,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,Next!,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,Hello.,6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.,6,S07E06,7
ELAINE,"I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery.""",6,S07E06,7
SOUP NAZI,That is my recipe for wild mushroom.,6,S07E06,7

NEWMAN,Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!,6,S07E06,7
JERRY,Wha - wha - what's the matter?,6,S07E06,7
NEWMAN,"Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more for of us!",6,S07E06,7
JERRY,"Well, where are you going?",6,S07E06,7
NEWMAN,He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!,6,S07E06,7

SUSAN,"Yeah, just tell me your code.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,My code?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,So why didn't you tell her the code?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,No. No way.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Actually, that's the definition of selfish.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Have you ever given your code to anyone?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.',7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Superman's father on Krypton.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.",7,S07E07,7

ELAINE,"Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?",7,S07E07,7
FRED,What was your name again?,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?,7,S07E07,7
FRED,Not ringing a bell.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?",7,S07E07,7
FRED,"Mmm, no.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.,7,S07E07,7
FRED,"The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.",7,S07E07,7

JERRY,What is that?,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,You're lucky they let you drive a car.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,What was that?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,What are you saying?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.",7,S07E07,7

JERRY,Why would I wanna do that?,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Yeah, sounds like fun.",7,S07E07,7
SUSAN,"I want you to tell me, George.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Why? Why is my code so important?,7,S07E07,7
SUSAN,"Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.,7,S07E07,7
SUSAN,My cycles?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, I never know what's going on there.",7,S07E07,7

JERRY,(to himself) My foot's asleep again!,7,S07E07,7
LEAPIN' LARRY,"When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business. But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.,7,S07E07,7
EMPLOYEE,That is a great impression!,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Larry, wait, you don't understand!",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Yup.,7,S07E07,7

KRAMER,"Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Wow, the whole building burned down.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Of course.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Where we gonna eat?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Of course not, if I did would you have gone?",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,No way.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,There you go.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Trust me, you're off.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Oh, hi Fred.",7,S07E07,7

FRED,"Oh yeah, yeah, right.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,How ya doin'?,7,S07E07,7

ELAINE,"Yeah, that's too bad.",7,S07E07,7
FRED,"Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.",7,S07E07,7

ELAINE,"No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Call the Embassy.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,They're closed.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Why?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Bomb threat.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,We're in Turkey?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Midnight Express, my friend.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.,7,S07E07,7

JERRY,"Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,J. Peterman.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Well, is Elaine here?",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Without Elaine? What for?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"What, is he crazy?",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"George, what's the matter with you?",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,I'm choking!,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?,7,S07E07,7
TV ANNOUNCER,It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You gotta love sports!,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make it there in time.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Well, Fred asked me out.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Fred?,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,I am? But that's so sick.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Anyway, so how was the dinner?",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,What about Georgie?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Nah, he didn't make it.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Doctor, how is she?",7,S07E07,7
DOCTOR,She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Shake off the dew, my friend.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Yeah. What time is it?,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Who?,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it helps.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!",7,S07E07,7
MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco. Bosco.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"Oh, shhh.",7,S07E07,7
MRS. PETERMAN,(sitting up) Bosco!,7,S07E07,7
MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Shut up! Shut up!,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,Momma! What are you trying to say?,7,S07E07,7
MRS. PETERMAN,Bosco.,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,She's gone. Bosco?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,I did not bail out on you.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Why didn't you come up with your own?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,I froze. I think I'm losing it.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.,7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,I am not giving you my code.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,I'll bet I can guess it.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Pssh. Yeah. Right.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Huh?,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Get out of here.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,I'm leaving.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,I gotta go.,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Shut up!,7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,Nestl's Quik!,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Shut up!,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,What was that?,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,What?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,I got a date.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Oh, Mr. Peterman.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.",7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,You do?,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,I have a personal commitment.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,What is it?,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.,7,S07E07,7
GEORGE,"Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,My pleasure.,7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,"You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,Fire station?,7,S07E07,7

JERRY,"Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Oh, so he took you back.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,No I didn't.,7,S07E07,7
CAPTAIN,"Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.",7,S07E07,7
CAPTAIN,"Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.",7,S07E07,7
JERRY,"Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.",7,S07E07,7

CAPTAIN,"Stay out of this, Kramer.",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?",7,S07E07,7
KRAMER,"Well, you'd better take it easy.",7,S07E07,7
FRED,"Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?",7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,Huh.,7,S07E07,7
FRED,The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's no transportation...,7,S07E07,7
ELAINE,"(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...",7,S07E07,7
FRED,"...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab, she'd start yelling at me, ""Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so expensive!"" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.",7,S07E07,7
PETERMAN,Bosco. Bosco. Bosco.,7,S07E07,7

GEORGE,I'd kill to be a 32.,9,S07E09,7
JERRY,She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!,9,S07E09,7
GEORGE,That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?,9,S07E09,7

GEORGE,Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?,10,S07E10,7

GEORGE,Hey.,10,S07E10,7

KRAMER,"(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.",10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,"Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.",10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,Oh. Oh God.,10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,You alright?,10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,"Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.",10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,"Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?",10,S07E10,7
COP,"Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, put these glasses on.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"(taking them) Well, what's this for?",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,So what?,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Well, he thinks you wear those.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,They're from the lost and found at the Alex.,10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.",10,S07E10,7
CASHIER,I don't think so.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?",10,S07E10,7
CASHIER,Not unless you buy something.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,I don't.,10,S07E10,7
CASHIER,Take a look.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,I know I gave it to you.,10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,"George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, look who's here.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"Ah, Lloyd.",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.,10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Oh, boy.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,"Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him, you can get it whenever you want.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,'s not necessary.,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"I know that, Kramer.",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,"Well, if you don't want to...",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"Yes I do, Kramer.",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,So...,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,Yeah?,10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,"How about that Elaine today, huh?",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.,10,S07E10,7
JERRY,I didn't see anything.,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.",10,S07E10,7
DEENA,You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.",10,S07E10,7
DEENA,"I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh, become very sensitive to the warning signs.",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,Warning signs?,10,S07E10,7
DEENA,"Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.",10,S07E10,7
DEENA,"Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,All my friends do that.,10,S07E10,7
DEENA,"George, I'm only trying to help...",10,S07E10,7
DEENA,"I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,You see that woman on the horse? (points),10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!",10,S07E10,7
DEENA,So again it all comes back to Lloyd.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,So you say she was on a horse?,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.",10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,Hey.,10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.",10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,(sits beside Jerry) What?,10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.",10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,"(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,Maybe it's in the lost and found.,10,S07E10,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,"You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.",10,S07E10,7
[Alex Theatre,Lobby],10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.",10,S07E10,7
HAARWOOD,"Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?",10,S07E10,7
HAARWOOD,They're half-glasses.,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,Brown?,10,S07E10,7
HAARWOOD,"Mmm, yes, yes.",10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.",10,S07E10,7
HAARWOOD,Certainly.,10,S07E10,7
HAARWOOD,Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.,10,S07E10,7

GEORGE,(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,(angrily) Oh you mother...,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,Hey! What is your problem?,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,"Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?",10,S07E10,7
CASHIER,Your car's on fire.,10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,Aah! Fire!,10,S07E10,7

GEORGE,The Jon Voight car is no more.,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.",10,S07E10,7
GEORGE,No kidding?,10,S07E10,7

LLOYD,Anybody see Elaine today?,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.",10,S07E10,7
LLOYD,"Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing, if you know what I mean.",10,S07E10,7
JERRY,Absolutely. Let's just stick around.,10,S07E10,7

KRAMER,Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?,10,S07E10,7
ATTENDANT,This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane to eat it.,10,S07E10,7
KRAMER,"No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.",10,S07E10,7

KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.",10,S07E10,7

HAARWOOD,"Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat generous proportions.",10,S07E10,7

CLYDE,"Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,"Georgie, can you zip me up?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"Yeah. Yeah, one second.",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,"Well, come on!",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,"Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"My in-laws. Oh, my....",11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to, huh?",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,I don't like that tie.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,How do you know what kind of ties they wear?,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,"George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?",11,S07E11,7
FRANK,Huh?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's? It's right over here.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something about taste!,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,This is gonna be fun.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,So what did he have to say?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.,11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Yeah.,11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,What did you do that for?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,What?,11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Oh,11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,"I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"Well, Clyde might not tell him.",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,How do you know that?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,I should have helped Kramer with those packages.,11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,Ohh!,11,S07E11,7
DENNIS,"Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...",11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,Uh-huh.,11,S07E11,7
DENNIS,"I wonder, could you pick up my mail?",11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,Yeah. Sure. Sure.,11,S07E11,7
DENNIS,"In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week?",11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,Drive the horse?,11,S07E11,7
DENNIS,It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. I'll split it with ya.,11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,"Oh, giddyup. Yeah.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.",11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,Oh.,11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,What is this thing anyway?,11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,It's Cornish gamehen.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"What is that, like a little chicken?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.",11,S07E11,7
FRANK,Gamebird?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Yeah.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?",11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,Yes.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,How hard could it be to kill this thing?,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.,11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,"If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, (laughing) I'd be broke.",11,S07E11,7
SUSAN,More wine anyone?,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,Yeah. I'll take some.,11,S07E11,7
SUSAN,Hmmm?,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,Thank you.,11,S07E11,7
SUSAN,How do you like the Merlot?,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?,11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,"Oh, mother.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.",11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Why don't we talk about it another time.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a chicken. Something's missing!",11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,Something's missing all right.,11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,That's perverse.,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Did anybody see Firestorm?,11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,"Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Yeah.,11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.,11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Oh mother of God.,11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,"Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!",11,S07E11,7
JOHN,"Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called "" Hot And Heavy.""",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Thank God that's over.,11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm sorry. It's impolite.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that!",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake!,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,What is this? The marble rye?,11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,"Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,We forgot to bring it in.,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"No, I brought it in. They never put it out.",11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,Where is it?,11,S07E11,7
SUSAN,I don't know. Where'd you put it?,11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,Right over there.,11,S07E11,7
SUSAN,"Well, it's gone.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,You stole the bread?,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should I leave it there?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Because we brought it for them!,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.",11,S07E11,7
MRS. ROSS,Is it possible they took it back?,11,S07E11,7
SUSAN,Who would bring a bread and take it back?,11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,"Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.",11,S07E11,7
ESTELLE,People take buses to get that rye.,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Maybe they forgot to put it out!,11,S07E11,7
FRANK,"Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I tell ya!",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,He stole back the rye?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Yeah.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Why?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"So, do the Ross's know?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,I don't know. They're all very suspicious.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Bad situation.,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,What do you mean replace it?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,So?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,What about Susan?,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Beautiful!,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,You think Kramer'll do it?,11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,"Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.,11,S07E11,7

JERRY,No. No thanks.,11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,"Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,Just put it under your shirt.,11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,Hey. Is that your horse outside?,11,S07E11,7
KRAMER,Yeah. That's Rusty.,11,S07E11,7

ELAINE,"Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"So, you think Clyde told him?",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,He wrote a song about it!,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"Well, maybe it's a good thing.",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?,11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,"You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!",11,S07E11,7
JERRY,"No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.",11,S07E11,7
ELAINE,"I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.",11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,"Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it.",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?",11,S07E11,7
MR. ROSS,"Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous George. Anything wrong?",11,S07E11,7
GEORGE,"Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?",11,S07E11,7

GEORGE,Dead?,12,S07E12,7
JERRY,"Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.",12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,My cars a little crumpled?!?,12,S07E12,7
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!",12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,"Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.",12,S07E12,7
JERRY,Well you gotta call your parents.,12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,"I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!",12,S07E12,7
JERRY,Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?,12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,OOuuoo! They could use the break!,12,S07E12,7
PETERMAN (holding up a bra),"Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what I'm holding in my hands?",12,S07E12,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, it's a bra.",12,S07E12,7
PETERMAN,"I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk)What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the elevator door closed. It was not to be.Perhaps our paths will cross again some day.",12,S07E12,7
ELAINE,w-What is this all about?,12,S07E12,7
PETERMAN,I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's fashion.,12,S07E12,7
ELAINE,"Oh-oh, but-",12,S07E12,7
PETERMAN,"We're gonna sell this as a top. Here's the angle Zelda Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties, driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk) Have it on my desk by the end of the week.",12,S07E12,7
STEINBRENNER,"Come in, come in.",12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,Mr. Steinbrenner--,12,S07E12,7
STEINBRENNER (shocked),"Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you?",12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.",12,S07E12,7
STEINBRENNER,"Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those.",12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,"Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.",12,S07E12,7
STEINBRENNER,"Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager.",12,S07E12,7
GEORGE,I didn't get the job?,12,S07E12,7
STEINBRENNER,"Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our hands. We had to make a move...",12,S07E12,7
STEINBRENNER,"But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, (George closes the door) chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?",12,S07E12,7
ELAINE (on the witness stand),"Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"And you have also brought with you, another bra, (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like, the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!",12,S07E12,7
ELAINE,"Yes, that's correct.",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"Uh, what was you golf score, the last round you played uh, before you shoulder was injured?",12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,Three under par.,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE (impressed),"Oooohhhh, three under par, HmmThat's what the professionals shoot, isn't it?",12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,Well if they're lucky.,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus?,12,S07E12,7
JERRY (hesitant),I...don't remember.,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the bra?",12,S07E12,7
JERRY,I don't know. Maybe.,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing a bra?!?",12,S07E12,7
JERRY,"....Alright, alright, I saw her!",12,S07E12,7
JERRY,"And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!",12,S07E12,7

JUDGE,You may step down.,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"Well Kramer, I think we got this wrapped up.",12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?",12,S07E12,7
STAN,"You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the cup.",12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,What do you mean?,12,S07E12,7
STAN,"Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"No, no, no, no!",12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,"Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,Stan? Who the hell is Stan?,12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,He's my caddy.,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake!,12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,Gu-gu- cada-,12,S07E12,7
JACKIE,"Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on the bra.",12,S07E12,7
JUDGE,"(bangs the gavel twice)This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.",12,S07E12,7
SUE ELLEN,"Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE (to Kramer and Stan),"Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin' now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin' to a caddy!",12,S07E12,7
KRAMER,"OK, OK-",12,S07E12,7
JACKIE ,"This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant, have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A bras gotta fit right up against a person's skin, like a glove!",12,S07E12,7
WOMAN #1,"Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?",12,S07E12,7
ELAINE,"Oh, no, I-I don't think so.",12,S07E12,7

WOMAN #1,Ciao.,12,S07E12,7
WOMAN #2,Ba-bye.,12,S07E12,7
ELAINE,"(awed) Oh, look at this!",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,What d'you think?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.",13,S07E13,7

ELAINE,"Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,I think your friend needs some help over there.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Hey!,13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,A little baby girl?,13,S07E13,7
KEN,Doctor says it could be any day now.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,Doesn't make you anything.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,"So, have you picked out a name yet?",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,"Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,Aww.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(negative) Hu-ho, boy.",13,S07E13,7
KEN,You don't like Kimberley?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Ech. What else you got?,13,S07E13,7
KEN,How about Joan?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,(warning) George!,13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,Pamela?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.",13,S07E13,7
KEN,What?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.,13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,"I don't know, it sounds a little strange.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?",13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Yeah, but uh... Soda?",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, that's right. It's working.",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,We'll put it on the list.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,I solve problems. That's just what I do.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,You're really going to town with that turkey there.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,It's on the door.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Ah, 's no good.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,No. That's bush league.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,What arrangement?,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Oh, hey.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Hey.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Hey. What's with your neck?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Ach, maybe.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,I don't know.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...,13,S07E13,7
<IMG SRC=http,//tinyurl.com/2b9c width=200 >,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Awright.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Aw, you really hurting, huh?",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Alright, lean forward, relax.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(worried) What? What?,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Encounter shiatsu.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Ah hah.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(seriously worried) Wha...?,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,He's a genius. Here we go...,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"From pain, will come pleasure.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Uh? Voila.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Awright, my work is done here.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,You really think he wants the bike?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Oh yeah.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,It took him like ten seconds!,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,I think they really went for that Soda.,13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,"What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,"I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,Yeah.,13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,What is that? Sign language?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"No, Seven.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,Seven Costanza? You're serious?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,...especially a girl. Or a boy.,13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,I don't think so.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"What, you don't like the name?",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,It's not a name. It's a number.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,It's awful. I hate it!,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(angry) Well, that's the name!",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven!,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Alright, you having a good time there?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Oh, I forgot to call Christie.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,(smug) I'm not engaged.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Ah, I got it.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Got what?,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Sort of a mooching inventory.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Alright.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.",13,S07E13,7
MAITRE D',"May I take your coat, miss?",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"Yes, thank you.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,The same outfit?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,The exact same outfit.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,How many days was it between encounters.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Three.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Very curious.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Indeed.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,How about 'Mickey'?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Hey buddy.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"No, that's yours. My half is gone.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,What?,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,You cannot buy half a can of soda.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Well, why not.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Alright.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"...You bite it, you bought it.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Thank you.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Hey.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,I always put you up here...,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(grudging) Alright.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,(points) Digidi.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,"Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Why not?,13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,"Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told them the name, they just loved it.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"So, what're you saying?",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,They're gonna name their baby Seven.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!",13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,I can't believe that they're using it.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!,13,S07E13,7
SUSAN,I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!",13,S07E13,7
MAN,Watch your step.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,Excuse me. Elaine?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Huh?,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, right?",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,Yes. How y'doing?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(bearing up) I'm fine.,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.",13,S07E13,7
VOICE 1 (O.C.),Lookin' good.,13,S07E13,7
VOICE 2 (O.C.),"Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,You got that right!,13,S07E13,7
KID,"(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!,13,S07E13,7
KEN (O.C.),Hello.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE (O.C.),(angry shout) Kramer!,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Kramer!!,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Hey,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Haven't seen him. How's the neck?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,You saw her? What was she wearing?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,What d'you care?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Did you have a nice ride?,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Oh, great ride.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,What're you talking about?! We had a deal!,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,What? You never told me that.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Well, it's common sense.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Yeah Jerry.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Alright, I'm down.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"So, that's the situation.",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Newman!,13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Uh, yeah.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,Yeah.,13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"Alright, let's begin.",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!",13,S07E13,7
KEN,Why can't we use Seven?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.,13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,"Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!",13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. It's very unusual.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,You don't care for Soda?!,13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,"(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,Oh!,13,S07E13,7
KEN,What is it?,13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,I felt something.,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Are you okay, honey?",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,I think I'm going into labour.,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the hospital...",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,Okay.,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,What about Six?,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,I know exactly what you mean.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you do.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY (V.O.),"What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,(horrified) Oh my god!,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Oh.,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment, so I can change?",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,Are we almost there?,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Just keep breathing, okay.",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,"(deep breaths) Okay, okay.",13,S07E13,7
KEN,Okay.,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.",13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Now's not the best time, George!",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...",13,S07E13,7
KEN,(firm) George! She's in labour!,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,(angry shout) So am I!,13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man...",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,What?!,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,Here we are.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"Well, I guess I'll go change.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Yes, change. By all means, change.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY (V.O.),"August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these dresses.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY (V.O.),There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,Ahem! Are you looking for something?,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,What're you doing? I thought you were changing.,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,"If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to bed.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.",13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?,13,S07E13,7
CHRISTIE,(gesturing) Get out.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,"(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!",13,S07E13,7
CARRIE,(shouts) I'm having a baby!!,13,S07E13,7
KEN,"George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,(desperate) Please! I have so little!,13,S07E13,7
ORDERLY,"Sorry sir, it's family only.",13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!,13,S07E13,7
GEORGE,Seven!!,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.",13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,(does a double take) Yikes.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,I know. Pretty steep.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"Well, I don't have this kind of cash.",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,Few do.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,I'm good for it.,13,S07E13,7
JERRY,"Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...",13,S07E13,7
JERRY,...the food court is closed.,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,"(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,Gangway!,13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,This is my bike!,13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,"Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.",13,S07E13,7
ELAINE,"(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...",13,S07E13,7
NEWMAN,Hey!! Help me!,13,S07E13,7
KRAMER,Hey! You're back!,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Oh, I'm back, baby.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, how was it?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,Good for you.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,I killed.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,You killed.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,Unbelievable.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,How much?,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Aw, c'mon.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,I tell you how much I make.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,And I'm always impressed.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Just show me the cheque, c'mon.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Awright, fine. You wanna see it?",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,I wanna see it.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Okay.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Here, check that out.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,I told you.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"My god, you're rich.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,(taking back the check) Oh yeah.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,What?,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,I never shoulda told you.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"No, I can't feel anything.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,(pleased) Really?,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,(deadpan) No.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Well, you should, Jerry.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Now, you see, that's nice.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Maybe a Cadillac.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Oh, isn't that what it's all about?",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,Who was Pippi Longstocking?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,"Pippi Longstocking? (thoughtful) Hmm, I don't don't know.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,Did she have anything to do with Hitler?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,Hitler? (thinks) Maybe.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Hey.,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,Hey George.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,(indicating) You remember Katy?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.",14,S07E14,7
KATY,"Also ear, nose and throat.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles),14,S07E14,7
KATY,(amused) He's funny.,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"Ah, you don't have to tell me.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"Oh, you know what? He got engaged.",14,S07E14,7
KATY,"Oh, you did? (disappointed) Oh.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,What? Is that bad?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Oh-ho, yeah?",14,S07E14,7
KATY,"You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(curious) Bald? Uh?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,Loves bald.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?",14,S07E14,7
KATY,Marisa Tomei.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(taken aback) The actress?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,Yeah.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,You're friends with Marisa Tomei?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,That's right.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!",14,S07E14,7
KATY,"Yeah, I know.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?,14,S07E14,7
KATY,"Yeah, she's just been sitting home.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,You gonna sleep on the fold-out?,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"(joyless) Yeah, yes.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,The actress?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Oh yeah.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Yeah?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,She happens to be very good friends with her.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Marisa Tomei?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Uh-hmm.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,How does she know Marisa Tomei?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"I don't know, I didn't ask.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Not the point!,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Alright.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Can I finish?,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"What d'you mean, could've?",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Ohh!,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Really?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"You know, she won an academy award?",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.,14,S07E14,7

JERRY,"Well, what about Susan?",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Would you tell Susan about it?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(frustrated) Not necessarily.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!,14,S07E14,7

JERRY,"Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,You don't seem too bothered by it.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"You remember what they did to me ten years ago? ""Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one"", or ""We'll be there between two and six""! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Boy, I've never seen you like this.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.",14,S07E14,7

GEORGE,I..I..I dunno.,14,S07E14,7
SUSAN,"Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.",14,S07E14,7
SUSAN,Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her more than you like me.,14,S07E14,7

GEORGE,"Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,Uhh. No George!,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Elaine.,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,Forget it!,14,S07E14,7

GEORGE,"D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,I can't believe you're buying your father a car.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,I had no idea you had this kind of money.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Ah, it's just money.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?",14,S07E14,7

JERRY,Are you okay?,14,S07E14,7

NICK,"Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Yeah.,14,S07E14,7
NICK,(quietly angry) All morning I been waiting here. All morning.,14,S07E14,7
NICK,(still angry) The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with it much longer.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,I'm loving this.,14,S07E14,7

GEORGE,(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(defensive) So what? So what if I do?,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,(shrill) You're engaged!,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, what the hell?!",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,George! It's cheating.,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,Yes it is!,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(frustrated) Ahh!,14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,(looking for support) Jerry!,14,S07E14,7

ELAINE,"Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.",14,S07E14,7
ELAINE,"Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,"Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box) There's already a box of cookies open.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,I wanted a Chip Ahoy.,14,S07E14,7

HELEN,"(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,What?,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,He's not buying us a Cadillac.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"What are you, nuts?",14,S07E14,7
HELEN,"It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of money.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,How d'you know?,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,"Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Why can't I buy my father a car?,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,Your father doesn't need a car.,14,S07E14,7

NICK (O.C.),"Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.",14,S07E14,7
NICK (O.C.),"Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be there from nine to one.",14,S07E14,7
NICK (O.C.),"I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!",14,S07E14,7
NICK (O.C.),You're not gonna get away with this!,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes right back to where I like it.",14,S07E14,7
JERRY,That's what I was thinking.,14,S07E14,7
JACK,"(pointing) Hello, Jerry.",14,S07E14,7

JACK,"No, thank you.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"C'mon, take a ride.",14,S07E14,7
JACK,I don't wanna take a ride.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,Why not?,14,S07E14,7
JACK,I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,He doesn't wanna take a ride.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,Uh huh.,14,S07E14,7
JACK,"(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before? Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,(skeptical) Thousands?!,14,S07E14,7
JACK,"What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a Cadillac?",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,(dismissive) Ahh!,14,S07E14,7
JACK,(dismissive) Yaah!,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,Could you believe that guy?,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Aahh!,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,Y'hello.,14,S07E14,7
NICK (O.C.),"(inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah, this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some trouble on your line.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.",14,S07E14,7
NICK (O.C.),"Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.",14,S07E14,7
NICK,We can fix that. We can fix that.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.",14,S07E14,7
NICK,"Oh, right. (laughing it off) I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong work order.",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.,14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,"Hey, McNab!",14,S07E14,7
KRAMER,Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?,14,S07E14,7

HERB,"C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing?",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.",14,S07E14,7
JACK,(half to himself) I'll bet you don't.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,What was that?,14,S07E14,7
JACK,"C'mon Morty, the jig is up!",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,What're you talking about?,14,S07E14,7
JACK,"I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue. I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.",14,S07E14,7
HERB,"What's going on, Jack?",14,S07E14,7
JACK,I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,Stealing?!,14,S07E14,7
RALPH,What proof do you have?,14,S07E14,7
JACK,Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want?,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,My son bought me that car!,14,S07E14,7
JACK,Your son?,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,Yeah.,14,S07E14,7
JACK,"Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year, at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!",14,S07E14,7
HERB,Jack's right! He stinks!,14,S07E14,7
RALPH,It's his material.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"I tell you, he bought it for me!",14,S07E14,7
HERB,(bangs table with his fist) I move for a full investigation!,14,S07E14,7
RALPH,I second.,14,S07E14,7
MARISA,...go introduce myself.,14,S07E14,7
SUSAN,"Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you have a thing for her?",14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,"(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?",14,S07E14,7
SUSAN,What are you talking about?,14,S07E14,7
MARISA,Have I told you how much I love you today?,14,S07E14,7
GEORGE,Not in the last fifteen minutes.,14,S07E14,7
MARISA,"Well, I do love you very much.",14,S07E14,7

HELEN,Impeachment?,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,Can they do that?,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,If they get the votes.,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have to move to Boca.,14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,Hello?,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,"Oh, hi Evelyn.",14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,"Hello, Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus.",14,S07E14,7
HELEN,What'd he say?,14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,He's voting to impeach.,14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,"Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,I did so thank him!,14,S07E14,7
HELEN,"(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"Ah, he's deaf anyway.",14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,"Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided.",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,Who's that?,14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,Mrs Choate.,14,S07E14,7
JERRY,Who's she?,14,S07E14,7
MORTY,"Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody. She's very tough to deal with.",14,S07E14,7
HELEN,"Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?",14,S07E14,7
MORTY,That's a good idea.,14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,"Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.",14,S07E14,7
HELEN,(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?,14,S07E14,7
EVELYN,"Yes, they're having a party.",14,S07E14,7
HELEN,We weren't invited.,14,S07E14,7

JERRY (V.O.),"Last week, on Seinfeld.",15,S07E15,7

JERRY,"(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Well, it's just two hours by plane...",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Gee, I dunno what to tell you.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Yeah?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Yeahhh.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Goodbye.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(smiling and flirty) Hi.,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,Hi.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"So, what d'you think?",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Uh, I don't think so.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(disappointed) Oh.,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,I'll be back on Monday.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(breathy) Bye.,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,Bye.,15,S07E15,7
KRAMER,Hello.,15,S07E15,7
JOHN,"Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.",15,S07E15,7
KRAMER,"Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?",15,S07E15,7
JOHN (V.O.),"Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the wires.",15,S07E15,7
KRAMER,"Oh, you don't say.",15,S07E15,7
JOHN,"(a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check.",15,S07E15,7
KRAMER,"(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.",15,S07E15,7
JOHN,(confused) What're you talking about?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Hey, where you going?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,I got stuff to do.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,What? You can't leave yet.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Why not?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,We have to discuss my alibi.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Alibi? What does that have to do with me?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Yes.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,What is the difference?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(dismissive) It's no good.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(pointedly) Okay. Fine.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,What?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(weary) Okay.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Alright?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Okay.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Okay.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Fine.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Good.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Fine, fine, fine.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Okay. How about this?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,What?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,I don't have a boyfriend.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(not convinced) Ech.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,It's good. Believe me.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,I thought my idea was just as good.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,The dentist thing?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Alright, the dentist thing was not good.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,That's your boyfriend.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,What does he do?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,He's an importer.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Just imports? No exports?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,It's very complicated.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,What're you doing? Are you making coffee?,15,S07E15,7
HELEN,Yeah.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"Morty, you're driving me crazy.",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me, I'll be a laughing stock.",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,There she is.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat.",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it.",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf you're wearing. Where did you get it?,15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"Ahh, they're a dime a dozen.",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,Gimme that rye!),15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"(shouting after him) Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,Nice to meet you.,15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,Hello.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from New York, didn't you?",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the street?",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a rye?",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.,15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,They're like savages.,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Yeah, there's some sickos out there.",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,(peering at Jerry) You look very familiar. Have we ever met?,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?,15,S07E15,7
HELEN,Maybe you've seen him on television.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,Jerry's a comedian.,15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"Naw, I don't watch TV.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Jerry, don't go.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Ah, I think I'll go.",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"Hey, where're you going?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Elaine? What for?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,I didn't even know she was dating anyone.,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,So what does he do?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,He's an importer-exporter.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,What kind of problems are they having?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Are you having an affair with Elaine?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Huh?,15,S07E15,7
NICK,(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You won't get away with this!,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Alright, are you ready to eat?",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time to eat. We're going to dinner.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?,15,S07E15,7
HELEN,(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,I don't understand why we have to eat now.,15,S07E15,7
HELEN,We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,You're not buying us dinner.,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!",15,S07E15,7
HELEN,"Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard of.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?",15,S07E15,7
MARISA,(laughing) You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. 'Ma' and the 'newer'.,15,S07E15,7
MARISA,Did you just make that up?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"What, you think I'm doing material here?",15,S07E15,7
MARISA,"(laughs) No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,(modest) And I'm a little tired.,15,S07E15,7
MARISA,"So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and funny, how is it you're not taken?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.",15,S07E15,7
MARISA,What?,15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,"I'm, you know, engaged.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY (V.O),"Hey look, there's a spot right in front.",15,S07E15,7
MORTY(V.O.),"Always, Jerry. Always.",15,S07E15,7
DORIS,Was that delicious or what?,15,S07E15,7
JACK,Where you gonna get a better meal than that?,15,S07E15,7
DORIS,Better than Danny's.,15,S07E15,7
JACK,Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,Hello Jack.,15,S07E15,7
HELEN,Doris.,15,S07E15,7
DORIS,"Hello, hello.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,Jack.,15,S07E15,7
DORIS,"Hello, Jerry.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,Hi Doris.,15,S07E15,7
JACK,"Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Yeah, so?",15,S07E15,7
JACK,(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.,15,S07E15,7
JACK,"Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.,15,S07E15,7
JACK,That's what you think.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,We'll see.,15,S07E15,7
JACK,"Yes, we will.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Awright, let's eat already.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Hi, Susan.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Hi.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Oh, sure.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Art Vandelay?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, Art Vandelay.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,It is so forgotten.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Alright.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"So, was George helpful at all?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,(not convinced) Yeah.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.",15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,What'd I say?,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,The importing.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(caught out) I did. Uh...,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"So, what does he uh, import?",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(extemporising) Uh... chips.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Oh. What kinda chips?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Potato.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,Ah.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,(embroidering) Some corn.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,And what does he export?,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Diapers.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Oh, no, it's okay.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,Okay.,15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Hi.,15,S07E15,7
SUSAN,"Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?",15,S07E15,7
GEORGE,Matches? Long matches.,15,S07E15,7
HERB,"...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here. We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a motion of impeachment of our president, (indicating) Morty Seinfeld.",15,S07E15,7
MORTY,"Nervous, Jack?",15,S07E15,7
JACK,What for?,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,Because I have the votes.,15,S07E15,7

MRS. CHOATE,"Hello, Morty.",15,S07E15,7
HERB,"Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?",15,S07E15,7

HERB,"It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty.",15,S07E15,7
RALPH,So why don't you say that?,15,S07E15,7
HERB,"Hey, I'm running the meeting.",15,S07E15,7

MRS. CHOATE,Help! Someone help!,15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"(after Jerry) Oh, thief! Thief!",15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,It's him. (pointing at Morty) It's your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye.,15,S07E15,7
MORTY,My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.,15,S07E15,7
RALPH,They should lock him up.,15,S07E15,7
MRS. CHOATE,"(pointing at Morty) Like father, like son. (thumps table) I change my vote. I vote to impeach!",15,S07E15,7

HERB,"Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is hereby installed as president.",15,S07E15,7
HERB,"Hear, hear, Jack.",15,S07E15,7
NICK,"(weary) Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win, okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology? Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well, that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing) Anyway, that's it.",15,S07E15,7
JERRY,"The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.",15,S07E15,7
ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.",16,S07E16,7
DOCTOR,I'll need a urine sample.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Right.,16,S07E16,7

ELAINE,I don't think so.,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,So what are your parents doing here in new York?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,So what are their plans?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Uncle Leo's having regular sex?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,(answering phone) Hello?,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,You gotta be there at 430.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,But it comes on 1130.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,How long they been doing this?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,30 years.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"All right, I'll see you later.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Yeah, it is.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"I mean, they're retired.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,No economic reason for them to be here.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,They have no friends.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,No social reason for them to be here.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,You're all grown up.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,I can do that.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,You know Dad just called me.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Ok.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Ahh.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,How's that gonna happen?,16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?,16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,"Ah, she's a real tiger.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,I don't know how you do it.,16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,What?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.",16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,What are you talking about?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Well...,16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,"Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Hey, it happens.",16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,He has no idea who you are.,16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,"They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, ""It's been real,"" move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.",16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,"Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Well, keep looking.",16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,What? Why not?,16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Opium?,16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.",16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.",16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"All right, Elaine.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.",16,S07E16,7
FRANK,"I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,What extremities?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,"So George, why are you here?",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,What's this.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,I don't bet.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.,16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,I don't swim.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.,16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,Are you trying to get rid of us?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,No?,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,Jerry? Jerry!,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Wha, you too?",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Yeah!,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Me either.,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,(leaving) Aw.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Where are you going?,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,I gotta find another shower.,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,They got you too?,16,S07E16,7
NEWMAN,This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Oh, Elaine. Yeah.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Kramer, you look terrible.",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,What's wrong with your shower?,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,There's no water pressure.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Why don't you just go see Jerry?,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.",16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,(busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Mr Peterman! What are you doing?,16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Huh?,16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. ""Just a taste,"" he said. That was all it took.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.",16,S07E16,7
PETERMAN,"Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 500 to clear out your desk. You're fired.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,All they serve is chicken?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,There's more food down the hall.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Wrap it up, we'll take it home.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Oh, hi.",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,Hello Seinfelds.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,Hello.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Hi.,16,S07E16,7
FRANK,This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.,16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,"Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for you.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Actually, I'm drunk.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Hey, hey, how was Florida?",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Well, we just bought a new place down there.",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,"I know, we were looking at the brochure.",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,What?,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"Why, you thinking of moving?",16,S07E16,7
FRANK,Not really.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that development.",16,S07E16,7
FRANK,Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista?,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,That's right. They went like hotcakes.,16,S07E16,7
FRANK,How'd you get yours?,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,Got lucky.,16,S07E16,7
FRANK,Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?",16,S07E16,7
WAITRESS,"Yeah, it's hard to figure.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.",16,S07E16,7
WAITRESS,"Ah, the bush-men?",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,And the bush-women.,16,S07E16,7
MAN,(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.",16,S07E16,7
MAN,"Well, you know what opium is made from...",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!,16,S07E16,7
JAY LENO,"Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,No good?,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,(offering a plate) Chicken?,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Poppy seeds!,16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Hello Newman.,16,S07E16,7
NEWMAN,"Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine, would you excuse us?",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Oh c'mon, Newman.",16,S07E16,7
NEWMAN,I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you don't mind?,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Jerry?,16,S07E16,7
NEWMAN,"Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown. From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Not from the footage I've seen.,16,S07E16,7
NEWMAN,"Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,I'm down.,16,S07E16,7
NEWMAN,Jerry?,16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,"So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Big news?,16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,We're moving to Florida.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?",16,S07E16,7
FRANK,"Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,What do you mean?,16,S07E16,7
FRANK,"They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del Boca Vista!",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,So you're moving there for spite!,16,S07E16,7
FRANK,Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,"So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Oh, every chance I get.",16,S07E16,7
ESTELLE,(warmly) Ohhh.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,What's going on?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,My parents are moving to Florida!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Are you kidding?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Where are they moving to?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Del Boca Vista!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,I know!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,We could visit together!,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Every five years!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,That's incredible!,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Why?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,To spite your parents!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,To spite my parents?,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Yeah!,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Your parents are crazy!,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,My parents are moving back too!,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,Beautiful!,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,Hello?,16,S07E16,7
VOICE,This is Frank Costanza.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,What do you want?,16,S07E16,7
FRANK,"You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse. We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Hello.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Hello, Jerry? It's your father.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Oh, hi dad.",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,What was that?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,But it's a big complex.,16,S07E16,7
MORTY,"You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)",16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,What?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,What? Why?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.,16,S07E16,7
GEORGE,"Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.",16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,Move back with Lydia?,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.",16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,"Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.",16,S07E16,7
JERRY,"Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.",16,S07E16,7
UNCLE LEO,But she's an anti-Semite.,16,S07E16,7
JERRY,Can you blame her?,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,Why would he mind? We're his parents.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Oh.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Hi Elaine.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Hello. Jerry's not here?,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,No.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,Huh. (pause) Oh my god.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,What?,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Why?,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,It's a long story.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,What are you gonna do in there?,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,What am I gonna do in the bathroom?,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,You gotta do me a favor.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"Elaine, I really--",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,You want my urine?,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,I need a clean urine sample from a woman.,16,S07E16,7
HELEN,I don't know.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"Well, what am I gonna do it in?",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Well, one of those glasses.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Jerry's glasses?,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,"Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?",16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,Or maybe a juice glass.,16,S07E16,7
ELAINE,"Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.",16,S07E16,7
HELEN,This one is kind of scratched.,16,S07E16,7

SALESMAN,"That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-",16,S07E16,7
KRAMER,"Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.",16,S07E16,7

MORTY,"First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?",16,S07E16,7
MORTY,Who is it?,16,S07E16,7

SALLY,Jerry!,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!,17,S07E17,7
SALLY,(Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly),17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?",17,S07E17,7
SALLY,Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.,17,S07E17,7

JERRY,(Blunt) I believe you.,17,S07E17,7
SALLY,"Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.",17,S07E17,7
SALLY,"Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,Oh?,17,S07E17,7

FRANK,"So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,A billiard parlor?,17,S07E17,7

GEORGE,"(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,(Confused) What photo?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said ""Costanza""?",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,"I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,Who is that?,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,"(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"So, you weren't born here?",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,"No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-,17,S07E17,7
FRANK,(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,The Maestro? What Maestro?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,Really? Why?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,Who?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,You know the Three Tenors?,17,S07E17,7

[Setting,Jerry's apartment],17,S07E17,7
JERRY,Ohh.. look at this..,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,What?,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.",17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.",17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Well, why don't you do your material?",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,I'm out.,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,"Hey, buddies.",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?",17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread),17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,Like what?,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) ""What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?""",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,(Confused) Where's the punchline?,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's),17,S07E17,7
GOERGE,"(Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,"Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) ""The Costanzas""",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,"No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.",17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..",17,S07E17,7

GEORGE,Oh my God! What is that?!,17,S07E17,7
SUSAN,(Rushing in) What? What is it?,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.,17,S07E17,7
SUSAN,"George, it's a doll.",17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,"I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!",17,S07E17,7

ELAINE,(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,Why?,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?,17,S07E17,7

JERRY,I thought you didn't want the doormat.,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.,17,S07E17,7

JERRY,Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!,17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,Who's Sally?,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,Susan's college roommate.,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.,17,S07E17,7
GEORGE,So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.,17,S07E17,7

ELAINE,I don't want it.,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.,17,S07E17,7

JERRY,"(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!",17,S07E17,7
SALLY,"This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.",17,S07E17,7

KRAMER,Come on. Are you sure?,17,S07E17,7
FRANK,I'd know him anywhere.,17,S07E17,7
MAESTRO,I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.,17,S07E17,7
FRANK,I still say we're related.,17,S07E17,7
MAESTRO,"(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)",17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,(Complaining) I can't make anything..,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.",17,S07E17,7
FRANK,Follow through? What do you mean?,17,S07E17,7
KRAMER,"Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..",17,S07E17,7

ELAINE,"Well, have you ever considered writing new material?",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?,17,S07E17,7

JERRY,"Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,What?,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.,17,S07E17,7

SALLY,"No, but he should be home soon.",17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.",17,S07E17,7
SALLY,Is this for your comedy routine?,17,S07E17,7

KRAMER,"Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..)

CARRERAS,My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster),17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,"(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his ""That's a shame"" face) Well, whatever.

JERRY,"(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled ""Ori-dent"") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"Well, I want to sit down.",17,S07E17,7
ELAINE,So?,17,S07E17,7
JERRY,"It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another.

ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, you...",18,S07E18,7
PETERMAN,"(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.",18,S07E18,7
PETERMAN,And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.,18,S07E18,7
ELAINE,"(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.",18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!",18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!",18,S07E18,7

GEORGE,You're soured?,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"Yeah, I'm soured.",18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,Don't be soured.,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,I'm sorry. I'm soured.,18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.",18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.",18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,"(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?",18,S07E18,7
JERRY,I'll try and de-sour.,18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,"(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!",18,S07E18,7
JERRY,(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.,18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,I still don't know what that means.,18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,"(neither does he) Yeah, well.",18,S07E18,7
KRAMER,God.,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!,18,S07E18,7
KRAMER,(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,Who?,18,S07E18,7
KRAMER,(shouts) Connie!,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,What'd she do?,18,S07E18,7
KRAMER,"I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.",18,S07E18,7
JERRY,(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?,18,S07E18,7
KRAMER,"(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!",18,S07E18,7
KRAMER,(to door) Gah!,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"Hey, there's uncle Milty.",18,S07E18,7

JERRY,I forgot to take it off.,18,S07E18,7
PAT,"(dubious) You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store, you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an idiot?",18,S07E18,7
JERRY,I'm sorry.,18,S07E18,7
PAT,Where's the jacket?,18,S07E18,7
JERRY,"Well, one of the gypsies took it.",18,S07E18,7
PAT,"(skeptical) Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!",18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,"(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.",18,S07E18,7
PAT,"(probing) Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?",18,S07E18,7
GEORGE,"No, I uh...",18,S07E18,7
PAT,"(interrupting) Then what am I talking to you for? (to Jerry) Jerry, bring the jacket back tomorrow.",18,S07E18,7

ATTENDANT,Can't do it',19,S07E19,7
GEORGE,Whadday'mean.?,19,S07E19,7
ATTENDANT,If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable.,19,S07E19,7
GEORGE,Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..,19,S07E19,7
ATTENDANT,What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs.,19,S07E19,7

TELLER,Spite?,19,S07E19,7
JERRY,That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.,19,S07E19,7
TELLER,I don't think you can return an item for spite.,19,S07E19,7
JERRY,What do you mean?,19,S07E19,7
TELLER,"Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund",19,S07E19,7
JERRY,"That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.",19,S07E19,7
TELLER,Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!,19,S07E19,7
TELLER,........spite.....(Manager walks over),19,S07E19,7
BOB,What seems to be the problem?,19,S07E19,7
JERRY,Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.,19,S07E19,7
BOB,That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.,19,S07E19,7
JERRY,. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it,19,S07E19,7
BOB,Well you already said spite so......,19,S07E19,7
JERRY,But I changed my mind..,19,S07E19,7
BOB,No...you said spite...Too late.,19,S07E19,7

MR. STEINBRENNER,All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army...... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty.,20,S07E20,7

ELAINE,He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,That's what I said.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Yeah.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Huh.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,What?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,No. nothing.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,What's with you?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Feel this.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Wow.That's hot.,20,S07E20,7

JERRY,She's also quite bold.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Oh bold and beautiful.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. (phone rings)What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,You know a lost and found could be a good idea.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Definitely.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"Hey, Elaine.",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Hi Jerry!,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,This is Nikki.,20,S07E20,7

NIKKI,"""Means to an End""",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,"Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see""Blame it on the Rain""",20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Why don't you see what you can do?,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Okay.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,We'll see.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Yeah. Why?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.",20,S07E20,7
TODD,So do you want a box?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Sure. If there cheap Why not.,20,S07E20,7

NIKKI,"Okay two tickets""Means to an End""",20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Told you.,20,S07E20,7

NIKKI,I just talked to the manager.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"All right. Enjoy""Blame it on the Rain""",20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Not bills.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,She's like a beautiful Godzilla.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Hey buddy.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,What the hell is all this?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,I am looking for quarters for the dryer.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Why can't you do this on your table?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Because I don't have a table.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Hey.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"Hey. So how was""Blame it on the Rain?""",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,No. We were both in the mood for one.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Oh is that so.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,What are you talking about?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,I don't buy it.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,So what happened after the movie?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Nothing. He walked me home.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,To the door?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Yeah.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,That's a date.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,No it's not.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,But I never walk you home.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,That's just because your a jackass.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"No, no.",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,"No, no.",20,S07E20,7
JERRY,So how did you leave it with him?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Your crazy!,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Crazy like a man.,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,Number 49.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,$ 6.50 your change.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,"And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)",20,S07E20,7
WORKER,Hey! You steal my money!!,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,No no. That's not what I was trying to do.,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,Beautiful. I am starving George.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,How about Chinese?,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,"Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket.",20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,"No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table.",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Thanks for the dinner.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,What?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,"Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.",20,S07E20,7
TODD,"Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,See what is that? Is that a date?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,All right. I am sorry it's not a date.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,All right.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Pick you up at 800 p.m.,20,S07E20,7
POLICE OFFICER,Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,I was got to be 55.,20,S07E20,7
POLICE OFFICER,That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,A lot faster than that!,20,S07E20,7
POLICE OFFICER,Step out of the car sir.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Okay dokey,20,S07E20,7
POLICE OFFICER,Can I have your license and registration please?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Absolutely. Nikki!,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Yes.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Not at all.,20,S07E20,7
POLICE OFFICER,I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,All right Nik. That's it.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,You got your shirt in my oven!?!,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,For both of us.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,What's wrong with your oven?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,I am baking a pie!,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Yeah.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Yeah.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Come on up.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,"You got cigars, huh.",20,S07E20,7
JERRY,I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,"Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?""Perducto de Peru""Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.",20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,You got ripped buddy.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,No. I never had a job.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants),20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,What the hell is this?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Yeah. You've heard of it?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,I'll see you guys later.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,What kind of pie are you cooking?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Huckleberry.,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,You certainly are in a bind.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Are you going to help me or not?,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,"All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.",20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,What?,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,All right.,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,That's a little steep don't you think?,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,"All right, all right.",20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,Do we have a deal?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,"I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,This is nice.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Gack. Party of four.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Party of four? Who are we meeting?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Mom! Dad! This is Elaine.,20,S07E20,7
MOM,Hello.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Hellllllooooo.,20,S07E20,7
MOM,Nice meeting you.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Bye mom.,20,S07E20,7
MOM,She's wonderful.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,What the hell was that?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,What?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Why did you introduce me to your parents?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,There nice people. I thought you would like them.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,"Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.",20,S07E20,7
TODD,Why is this a date?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Well if it's not a date then what is it?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,It's a lovely evening together.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,I don't believe this.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Well I am getting a cab want to join me?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,No. I'll just walk home.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Okay goodnight. (goes to kiss her),20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Now what was that?,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,Hello. What 's this?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,Work? It's raining.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Soooooo,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,"You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.""Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....""It's the first one.",20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,I was never that big on creeds.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,But I'm paying you!,20,S07E20,7
NEWMAN,Yes thank you. (slams door),20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Newman!!,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,I did.,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,Okay.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Kramer!,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Hey you!,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,What happened to Newman?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,He called in sick.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Oh yeah right it's raining.,20,S07E20,7

KRAMER,Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Hey Todd.,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Hi. You know Nikki.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Yeah sure.,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,"Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the""M""stand for in Richard M. Nixon?",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Milhouse.,20,S07E20,7
NIKKI,I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner.,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,That's all I got.,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,I told you this is all I got.,20,S07E20,7
WORKER,Then no calzones.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,What happened? Where have you been?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,What the hell happened to your shirt?,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,He overcooked it. It's ruined.,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,(on phone) That's right. Do you want to say it again. I'll say it again. I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not. And how's this. Your fired. Okay your not. I am just a little hungry. Where's Costanza with my calzone. It's 115. He's late. That smell. I have to call you back. Costanza. He's in the building. Costanza is in the building and he's not in this office. Costanza! I'll get you.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,These are terrible.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Where are you going?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,But she broke up with you.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,"I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.",20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,It smells like a rubber fire.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,What's that?,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,I said rubber fire.,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Oh.,20,S07E20,7
ELAINE,Did you ever pay Todd for these things?,20,S07E20,7
JERRY,Actually it's being taken care of right now.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,You Gack?,20,S07E20,7
TODD,Yeah.,20,S07E20,7
KRAMER,Here's your money.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's?,20,S07E20,7
GEORGE,Because they were heated up there.,20,S07E20,7
MR. STEINBRENNER,Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea.,20,S07E20,7
WILHELM,And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"I know, sir. It won't happen again.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,Lemme think here.,21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,Elaine.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"Hi, Mr Peterman.",21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,I do.,21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,The pygmy pullover.,21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,"Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.",21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,Whatever.,21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,"But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.",21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?",21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,"I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.",21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,Wow.,21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Yes, sir.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"I will, sir. Top priority.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,(exiting) Top priority.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,Top priority.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,He pulled an LBJ on you.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,LBJ?,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,No kidding?,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,Hey buddy.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Hey.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,Hey.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Can I have my keys...,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"(catching keys) ...back, please?",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"You shoulda come, Jerry.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,We made quite a haul.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,Where'd you go?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,Price club.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,Why didn't you take your car?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,"Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,(taking bottle) Refund?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,Yes.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,"I don't know, they're deranged.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Awright, I'll see you later.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,"(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,Ten cents!?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,Yeah.,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,"Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"No, it doesn't work.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"No, no, I'm off that.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,You tried it?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN/KRAMER,(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.",21,S07E21,7
SUE ELLEN,Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,Hi Sue Ellen.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Hi Sue Ellen.,21,S07E21,7
SUE ELLEN,I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.,21,S07E21,7
SUE ELLEN,"Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.",21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,I wanna learn. I want to know why.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.",21,S07E21,7
AUCTIONEER,"Lot number seven forty-five. We have a full set of golf clubs, that were owned by President John F Kennedy, as seen in the famous photograph of the president chipping at Burning Tree on the morning of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The set in perfect condition, and we will start the bidding at four thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars? Do I have four thousand dollars?",21,S07E21,7
AUCTIONEER,I have four thousand dollars. Do I have five? (another person bids) Five thousand dollars. I have five thousand dollars. Do I have six? Six thousand dollars for this set of beautiful clubs. (another bid) Six. I have six thousand dollars. Can I have sixty-five hundred?,21,S07E21,7
AUCTIONEER,"Sixty-five hundred to the dark-haired person on the right. We are at sixty-five hundred, do I hear sixty-six hundred?",21,S07E21,7
AUCTIONEER,The president's own golf clubs. Leisure life at Camelot. Sixty-five hundred going once...,21,S07E21,7

AUCTIONEER,Eight thousand. We have eight thousand. The bid is now eight thousand dollars.,21,S07E21,7

JERRY,Do you hear this clunking?,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,(listening) A little.,21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.",21,S07E21,7

KRAMER,"Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.",21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,We ran outta space.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.,21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,"Ah, Tony, he's good.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?',21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"No, thank you.",21,S07E21,7
TONY,"(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,There's really nothing wrong on the inside.,21,S07E21,7
TONY,"Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?",21,S07E21,7
JERRY,"No, I hadn't noticed.",21,S07E21,7
TONY,(accusingly) Have you been picking at it?,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.,21,S07E21,7
TONY,(disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see.,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.,21,S07E21,7
TONY,You been rotating the tires?,21,S07E21,7
JERRY,Try to.,21,S07E21,7
TONY,(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.',21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,"Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.",21,S07E21,7
ELAINE,"I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...",21,S07E21,7
PETERMAN,"Well, where are they?",21,S07E21,7

GEORGE,"Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"(confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Well, I was wondering...",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,You mean you haven't been to payroll?,21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.",21,S07E21,7
WILHELM,"Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!",21,S07E21,7

CLERK,"(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.",21,S07E21,7
CLERK,"Well, maybe I will.",21,S07E21,7
GEORGE,"(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.",21,S07E21,7

KRAMER,"Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.",21,S07E21,7

KRAMER,(interested) Uh-huh.,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,"But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.",21,S07E21,7
KRAMER,(realisation) Mother's Day.,21,S07E21,7
NEWMAN,The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.,21,S07E21,7

JERRY,I really wanna...,21,S07E21,7

so far,"Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George has been given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine outbids Sue-Ellen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs on behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer and Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry has to take it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When Jerry asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him.",22,S07E22,7

ELAINE,They happened to be in the back seat at the time.,22,S07E22,7

JERRY,"You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?",22,S07E22,7
DETECTIVE,"All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?",22,S07E22,7
JERRY,Had I been taking...?,22,S07E22,7
DETECTIVE,"Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.",22,S07E22,7

WILHELM,"Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.",22,S07E22,7
JERRY,"I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.",22,S07E22,7
GEORGE,"Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.",22,S07E22,7

JERRY,No one's gonna listen to you.,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,I am not qualified to run the catalog!,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,You're not qualified to work at the catalog.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Where?,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Myanmar.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,The discount pharmacy?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Karate?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Katra?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, ""Yes, I can!""",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Sammy Davis had it.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Sure you have.,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,(excitedly) Okay.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,That kid is gonna be all right.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"No, she's not.",1,S08E01,8
JOEY,"Come on, Kramer!",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Hey there.,1,S08E01,8
JOEY,Come on. Mom's down in the car.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Okay, Joey.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,You guys both have class at the same time?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"No, we're in the same class.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,What do you mean you're in the same class?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,He almost beat me.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Kramer, you're fighting children?!",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,I got carpool. (exits),1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.",1,S08E01,8
JOEY,"Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?",1,S08E01,8
MRS. ZANFINO,"Mmm, I don't know...",1,S08E01,8
MRS. ZANFINO,All right.,1,S08E01,8
KIDS & KRAMER,Yay!,1,S08E01,8
DUGAN,*You're* taking the job?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!",1,S08E01,8
SANSEI,Are you prepared for kumite?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER & JOEY,"Yes, Sansei.",1,S08E01,8
SANSEI,Fight stance.,1,S08E01,8
SANSEI,Hydjama! Begin!,1,S08E01,8
SANSEI,(raising Kramer's arm) Winner!,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,It's open!,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,(surprised) Rosses.,1,S08E01,8
MRS. ROSS,"Hello, George.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)",1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,"We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)",1,S08E01,8
MRS. ROSS,We know the last three months have been hard on you.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.",1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,"And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.",1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Oh, that's wonderful.",1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,"And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?",1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,You'll be on the board of directors.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...",1,S08E01,8
MRS. ROSS,"Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,I can't believe this is happening.,1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,"Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, ""She's not really dead if her shadow is..."" Uh, w-what was it, dear?",1,S08E01,8
MRS. ROSS,"Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?",1,S08E01,8
MR. ROSS,"Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.",1,S08E01,8
MRS. ROSS,So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,(feigning happiness) The second I see him.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Hey.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Hey. How's your day, good?",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"No, no, no, it's... ""She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.""",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Hey, board of directors. Look at you!",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Don't you see? I'm back in.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,All because of Wrath of Khan?,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Yes!,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Well, it was the best of those movies.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,KHAN!,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,George.,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,George. (taps him on the shoulder),1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,(startled) Oh!,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Wink.,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,(correcting him) Wyck.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Wyck.,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Oh. I know they have some monies.,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--",1,S08E01,8
WYCK,Yes.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,And now?,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,This townhouse?,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,This would have been your wedding gift.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,And now?,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,Not.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Not.,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"You know, it really can't.",1,S08E01,8
DOLORES,So who broke it off?,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.",1,S08E01,8
DOLORES,"Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,I am. It was the world's first.,1,S08E01,8
DOLORES,"You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits)",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,(answering) Hello?,1,S08E01,8
SECRETARY,Please hold for Elaine Benes.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Oh, I don't believe this.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,(picking up) Jerry!,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Hey!,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,How's it look?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Huh?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"I say, it's a peach.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,I gotta do some research here.,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Oh, I'm the doofus?",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Kramer!,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Oh, hey.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,What are you doing?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,You never said you were fighting children.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Search... for Spock?!,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,(pushes him) You doofus!,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.",1,S08E01,8
WAITRESS #1,More.,1,S08E01,8
WAITRESS #2,Less.,1,S08E01,8
RUTHIE,Same.,1,S08E01,8
WILLIE,Are we about through here?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.,1,S08E01,8
JOEY,She had a little change of plans.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?",1,S08E01,8
GIRL,Now we finish it.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Aah! Aah! Mama!,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,So... did you stop by the dojo?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Yep.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,How's your confidence level?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Shot.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Self-esteem?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,Gone.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Doofus?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,(raises her hand) Yo.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,What is that?,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Well, nobody sees the... cover.",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,God!,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,What happened to you?,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!,1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"Well, then I was way off!",1,S08E01,8
ELAINE,"Well, I'll see ya... (exits)",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Vaya con dios.,1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"No, he's still stuck at the foundation.",1,S08E01,8
KRAMER,"You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.",1,S08E01,8
JERRY,Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research),1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Would I have had access to that?,1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"Of course, it would have been yours.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,And now?,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,(anticipating the answer) Not.,1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,Hello?,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,My story?,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?",1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"(chuckling) Oh, no, not even close.",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,(remorsefully) I can't go.,1,S08E01,8
JERRY,"What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!",1,S08E01,8
WYCK,"Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?",1,S08E01,8
GEORGE,You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!,2,S08E02,8
WYCK,"Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)",2,S08E02,8
WYCK,Pardon?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,(mutters it again),2,S08E02,8
WYCK,"Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,He cleared his throat?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Yes!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,So?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"He did it right as he said ""her unfortunate accident.""",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Not getting it.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Oh, help me, Rhonda.",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,What time is it?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY (looks at his watch),115,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Right now?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,I gotta go meet Pam.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Where's Elaine?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,What's with all these people having babies?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Perpetuation of the species.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Yeah! Right!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"By the way, just for the record -",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)",2,S08E02,8
CAROL,"...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Well, that's...that's sweet.",2,S08E02,8
GAIL,Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.,2,S08E02,8
CAROL,"Elaine, you gotta have a baby!",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...",2,S08E02,8
LISA,Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,I really like the city.,2,S08E02,8
CAROL,The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Uh, it was in the Hamptons.",2,S08E02,8
CAROL,Oh! I have pictures!,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"No, no, that's okay, it's uh...",2,S08E02,8
CAROL (shows Elaine and the girls pictures of Adam),Look at him! Just look at him!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Jerry Lewis?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,That's pretty paranoid.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Yes, it is.",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,I like it!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,I thought you might.,2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER (mouths the words),Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.),2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Oh, careful! (Jerry enters.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Hi, sorry I'm late.",2,S08E02,8
PAM,That's okay. Kramer let me in.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.",2,S08E02,8
PAM,Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Go on.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Ah, yes. Forbidden love.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"""Pam."" I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.),2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.),2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,She has delicate beauty.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"And yet, he's my friend.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I thought we were talking about me.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Confront Jerry? I can't.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,You must!,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I won't!,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,You will!,2,S08E02,8
"ELAINE (to Jerry, imitating Carol)","""Elaine, ya gotta have a baby."" Ugh.",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Where are all the poetry magazines?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,The New Yorker has poetry.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Yes. The New Yorker.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"C'mon, you want to have a baby.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Why? Because I can?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!,2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Oh, I'm sorry.",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,"No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, like you must procreate.",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,"Besides, anyone can do it.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.",2,S08E02,8
WYCK,"Are you okay, George?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)",2,S08E02,8
WYCK,"...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.)",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE (apologetic),Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.),2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,Not at all.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER (wipes chocolate off his face),"Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Oh. Are you alright?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'll be okay.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Oh, no...that won't last.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,What do you mean?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,He's not ga-ga.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,How long did you leave it up there?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Five minutes. What the hell happened here?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Is that it?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Stopped dead.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,What do you make of it?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.),2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Jerry. Uh, can we talk?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE (to Kramer),Kinda busy here.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Why can't I stay?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Because it doesn't concern you.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"So, what's on your mind?",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,It's Pam.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Pam? What about Pam?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"I love her, Jerry!",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,You what?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I love her!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Is that right?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,What does that mean?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Oh, and that voice!",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,What about her name?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,She's got really nice hair.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,You've got really specific tastes.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,She's got nice calves.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"No you can't, Jerry.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,But I might.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Oh, no you don't.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,What...?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER (frantic),Huh?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Pam!,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Huh?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Pam!,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,So now he wants her more than ever!,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Blast!,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"What am I gonna do, huh?",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"What, again with you?",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,If only I could say things like that around her.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN (getting an idea),Yes...,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.',2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"It's baffling, isn't it?",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Ga-ga? When did that happen?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Yesterday. Six-ish.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,You just met the guy yesterday.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, but we have a common goal.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE (happily),Yeah.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, of course.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, ""Pardon my French.""",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)",2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Oh, hi! Kramer.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN (whispers through the bookcase),Hi. How are you?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Hi. How are you?,2,S08E02,8
PAM,I'm great.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,I too am well.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I too am well.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Do I smell Pantene?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Do I smell?,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Pantene!,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Uh, Pantene.",2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with Newman),"Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN (frantic),...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.),2,S08E02,8
PAM,What?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.",2,S08E02,8
PAM,That's so true.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Shell.,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.,2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Kramer, that is so lovely.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.,2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Oh, what's his name?",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,"Elaine, you've changed my life.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,I got a vasectomy this morning.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Although, I have a hunch you mean it.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.",2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY's brain,A velvet scrunchie!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Kramer!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Hello, Newman.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.),2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN (sweating),"Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Why not?,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)",2,S08E02,8
JERRY (rolls his eyes),C'mon. (They exit.),2,S08E02,8
JERRY,I can't believe I'm losing Pam!,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,I thought we were talking about me.,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,Right.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane ""observations""?",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,"Well, there is a little something you can do for me...",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"C'mon, out with it.",2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,It's about...Elaine.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN,You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY (shrugs),"Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,What was that?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,"This is! Oh boy, I always do this.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,What?,2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,"Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Really?,2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,"Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,"You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...",2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.,2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Yeah!,2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,Yeah!,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,When did you build this thing?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...",2,S08E02,8
JERRY (points at the Power Ranger),"Wait, that's you?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Yeah.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY (picks up a yellow M&M toy from the model),I really think the M&M should be you.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE (grabs the M&M away from Jerry),"Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,And?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,Okay. That's what we know.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,But we already knew that.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Well, yeah.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,I don't know if you're ready for it.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Please.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?",2,S08E02,8
VOICE ON SPEAKER,It's Pam.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,"C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)",2,S08E02,8
PAM,What was that?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,We were just playin.',2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Uh huh...,2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.)",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!,2,S08E02,8
JERRY (to Pam),This is the man you have a crush on?,2,S08E02,8
PAM,"Well, I have feelings for both of you.",2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,Why can't I be a soul mate?,2,S08E02,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?",2,S08E02,8
PAM,Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.",2,S08E02,8
WYCK,George...,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...""Dear God!"" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.",2,S08E02,8
WYCK,"George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.",2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,What are you guys doing here?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,We're getting vasectomies.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Why?,2,S08E02,8
NEWMAN (to Elaine),I'm doing it for you.,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,What?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY (to Elaine),What'd you do to your hair?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,I cut it.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY,It's a little short.,2,S08E02,8
KEVIN,Y'think?,2,S08E02,8
JERRY (to Kevin),What are you doing here?,2,S08E02,8
ELAINE,Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.,2,S08E02,8
JERRY and NEWMAN,"Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)",2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.,2,S08E02,8
WYCK,Is that a Keats poem?,2,S08E02,8
GEORGE,"No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)",2,S08E02,8
WYCK,Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?,2,S08E02,8
MR. CROSS,"Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.",2,S08E02,8
MS. BAINES,Of course he killed her.,2,S08E02,8
WYCK,"So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.",2,S08E02,8
JERRY,All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,Fine.,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,"They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?",3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,"But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!",3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,(resigned) At least it's show business..,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,What if she's got no interest in you?,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.,3,S08E03,8
[Exterior long shot,"looking up at an office building; Interior of office reception area of ""Brand/Leland"" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]",3,S08E03,8
KRAMER,"George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?",3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!",3,S08E03,8
KRAMER,(frustrated) Wha??,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,(dry) He knows.,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!",3,S08E03,8
KRAMER,"(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.",3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,You sure?,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,(dry) He knows.,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,Wow. Nice.,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,Why don't you try your engagement story?,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,Are you sure?,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,(wry) He knows.,3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,"Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)",3,S08E03,8
KEVIN,Friends?,3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,"Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.",3,S08E03,8
KEVIN,Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!,3,S08E03,8
MAN,(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..,3,S08E03,8
KRAMER,"You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)",3,S08E03,8
MAN,"Come on, let's go.",3,S08E03,8
KRAMER,"(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)",3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,"(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,"(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,Not bad. Wuh--what does she--,3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,(dry) I put her stats on the back.,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,"Pretty impressive--""Serious boyfriend '92 to '95."" Owns her own car.. ""Favorite president James Polk!"" (ELAINE had echoed ""Uh-huh. Yup."" during it)",3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,Hnn! Let me see that.,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,"(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?",3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.,3,S08E03,8
JERRY,Why would anybody want a friend.,3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,"(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..",3,S08E03,8
JERRY,What?,3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,"Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!",3,S08E03,8
ELAINE,"(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)",3,S08E03,8
GEORGE,(getting up) Can I keep this?,3,S08E03,8

ELAINE,Yeah.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Food?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,Uh huh.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Bar?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,Yeah.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,George?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,He's gonna show up anyway.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"George, I just don't want you interfering.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,How could I possibly interfere?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,No thanks.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Hi ah, My name is George.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves),4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,So...,4,S08E04,8
MAN,How 'bout leading us in a toast?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Sweet Fancy Moses!,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,You get the tickets?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Yeah I guess I do owe you.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"No, I'm okay.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"There's no problem, really.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Food was good.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Elaine danced?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"What, you mean you know about this?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,And by then you've lost interest.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,What made him get that thing?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer),4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Brody's in.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I don't even have the extra ticket yet.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Well, you better get on the horn.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,How could that be?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"No, George was there, he said he had a great time.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Oh, what are you talkin' about?",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Now you're talkin' crazy!,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,You have a minute to approve some copy?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,It was a real... kick.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,As a matter of fact I did.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Why? He seems harmless.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,Oh he's not. He's very harmful.,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Really?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,And you two are friends?,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, we're good friends.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,So this Anna called me from out of the blue.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Really? I thought you were rebuffed.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,With extreme prejudice.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Yes ... yes, yes",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Okay, the point is made.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Half of show business is here.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,There's Brody. Brody! Over here.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,It's for all of us. Is there a problem?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I'm a joke maker.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Relax, he does that all the time.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Does what?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,May I see you outside for a moment please?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,But I want to--,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Outside!,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Hey, have you seen Anna?",4,S08E04,8
WORKER,"Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?,4,S08E04,8
WORKER,"The park, why?",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,It's not legitimate.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,It's a business.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Where did you meet this guy?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Kramer. (boom sound),4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I don't believe this. (They run into theater),4,S08E04,8
ANNA,You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,No... a little. Nice car.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, she's a sweet ride.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Is that your orthopedic back pillow?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Maybe.,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Well is it or isn't it?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Guess not.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,(To George) Stay away from her.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,I didn't do nothin'.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,(To Anna) Get in the car.,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,But...,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Lighten up.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?",4,S08E04,8
(Movie Voice,"So Death Blow, we meet again ...)",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"Uh, I got a cramp.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Hey, what is going on over there?",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, if the man is in pain...",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,(pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Oh man...,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,How was the rest of Death Blow?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"He's quite a character, isn't he?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,I got it. Yep.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Brody.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Come on up. It's Brody.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,What if I didn't do it right?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,It's your first time. He'll understand.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Hey, Brody!",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Hi.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Yeah.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,I've never seen such beautiful work.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,What?,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"(con,t) You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Well, I did the best I could.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,May I use your phone?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Uh yeah. It's under the couch.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,We're talkin' federal crime here.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,(To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat),4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Sure, do you need a glove?",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Nah.,4,S08E04,8
WORKER,"I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh)",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,What? What is so funny?,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,"Sorry, I got hung up.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,At Yankee Stadium?,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,This? It's mine.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,He's not stocky.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,Who did that? Who did that?!?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,That's fine.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Do you even know what this scene is about?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Wha? Where?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Right here. (Elaine enters),4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,(He shows her) This umpf thing.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,It's dancing.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,I dance fine.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,You stink. (He exits),4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away),4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Jerry, do I stink?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"All right, you're beyond stink.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,But I really enjoy dancing.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,It's that bad?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.",4,S08E04,8
VOICE,I have George Costanza still holding.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Yo, Anna.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,"Hi, George. What're you up to?",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,(Ironing) You don't wanna know.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"What, wha, what're you talkin' about?",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,I never should have given Anna the impression--,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Pick it up, pick it up!",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,What?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,You are ruinin' everything.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,"Um, no, I don't think so.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,I'm a bad man!,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,So where's the tape?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,I need the tape.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Are you out of your mind?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Kramer...,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"All right. That's it, I can't work like this.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Jerry...,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I'm off the project. (He exits),4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Jerry!,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,I want the tape.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Yeah.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Did you say dangerous?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,I'm a bootlegger.,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,You're a what?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,"I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Isn't that illegal?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,I can do hard time for this one. And community service!,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,Is this your FiberCon?,4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, George got arrested.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,What?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.,4,S08E04,8
BRODY,"Brody, I'm comin' up.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,What're we gonna do?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Where's the tape?,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Uh, well. It, uh...",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,Is that it?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.",4,S08E04,8
BRODY,How'd it turn out?,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER + JERRY,Uh... great.,4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.,4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.",4,S08E04,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, it's a disturbing image.",4,S08E04,8
JERRY,"Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.",4,S08E04,8
ANNA,"(George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it.",4,S08E04,8
GEORGE,Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters),4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,Anna...,4,S08E04,8
ANNA,"Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.",4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,"All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)",4,S08E04,8

FRANK,My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.,4,S08E04,8
ELAINE,You got that right.,4,S08E04,8
FRANK,What the hell does that mean?,4,S08E04,8

NEWMAN,"Yeah, tell me about it.",5,S08E05,8
KRAMER,"See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.",5,S08E05,8
NEWMAN,"What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?",5,S08E05,8

DOCTOR,Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,"Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.",5,S08E05,8

GEORGE,Smile,5,S08E05,8
JERRY,What are you doing?,5,S08E05,8
GEORGE,"I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something",5,S08E05,8

JERRY,Not the gown again.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,"No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?",5,S08E05,8
JERRY,They have gotten to know you.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.,5,S08E05,8
GEORGE,Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.,5,S08E05,8
JERRY,Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,Listen to me you little shi........,5,S08E05,8
GEORGE,Smile.,5,S08E05,8
DOCTOR,Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.,5,S08E05,8
DOCTOR,All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,Where did you get my chart?,5,S08E05,8
DOCTOR,From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.,5,S08E05,8
ELAINE,You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......,5,S08E05,8
DOCTOR,Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.,5,S08E05,8

GEORGE,No good?,5,S08E05,8

SHEILA,I don't know where they could be.,5,S08E05,8

RON,Really?,5,S08E05,8
SHEILA,Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere.,5,S08E05,8

JERRY,I'm clean and you know it.,5,S08E05,8

JERRY,Where did you get that?,5,S08E05,8
GEORGE,I think that's one of mine.,5,S08E05,8
NEWMAN,It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.,5,S08E05,8
JERRY,I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.,5,S08E05,8
NEWMAN,Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....,5,S08E05,8

GEORGE,Laundry? Dry cleaning?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"It's not a valet, it's a protg.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,(checking out George's textbook) Risk management?,6,S08E06,8

BANIA,"Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?",6,S08E06,8
MAN,Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.",6,S08E06,8
MAN,"Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Reading for the Blind?,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.",6,S08E06,8

GEORGE,What did you have?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,Marsala?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Hey, good luck with that.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,Thank you.,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,Dad.,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,What are you doing here?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,What's the matter with him?,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,Shell-shocked?,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,I'm ready.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Oh, okay.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIT,"(reading) It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,Nothing at all.,6,S08E06,8
DOCTOR,"Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"You're a very handsome man, by the way.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,What the hell is going on here?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,What are you doing?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"No, I don't want to.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,Hah?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Oh, this is awful.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Did you follow the recipe?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,It tastes like dirt.,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,My stuffed cabbage!,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,"So, great dinner last night.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Yeah, it was alright.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"No. No, no way, no Bania.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,What?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Cynthia would not date a hack.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Would. Does. Is.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.",6,S08E06,8
EMPLOYEE,You promoted him?,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Well, no, I would hardly--",6,S08E06,8
EMPLOYEE,I bust my hump ever day.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,Relax--,6,S08E06,8
EMPLOYEE,"As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protg can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit!",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!",6,S08E06,8
VOICE,Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,This guy sounds just like me.,6,S08E06,8
VOICE,"To understand risk, we must first define risk.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,This is horrible.,6,S08E06,8
VOICE,Risk is defined as--,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"In my mind, there's a war still going on.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,What happened?,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!",6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,So you saw Bania's act?,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,"Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,No more mentor?,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Looks that way.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Well at least you and I are okay again.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Why?,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,I can tell you what to do.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,"No, it's more than that.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,I can tell you what to think.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,I need someone I can trust.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Oh.,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Kind of in the middle of something here, George.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,George?,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,I gotta run anyway.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Yeah, see ya.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,What's your problem.,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,No problem.,6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,"Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,Oh.,6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,(reading) It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,"Well, I'm not married to it.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,Dewy meadow.,6,S08E06,8
ESTELLE,Here's your omelet.,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,It's dry.,6,S08E06,8
ESTELLE,That's the way I always make it.,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,Well it sucks.,6,S08E06,8
ESTELLE,What did you say?,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!",6,S08E06,8
ESTELLE,"Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protg?,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,"I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.",6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,"I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Alright.,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,Okay.,6,S08E06,8
BANIA,Hey Jerry.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Oh, hey Bania.",6,S08E06,8
BANIA,Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Oh, that's too bad.",6,S08E06,8
BANIA,"Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--",6,S08E06,8
BANIA,You think you can give me a hand with my material?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,Hey.,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,You still need a cook?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,Ya got T-Fal?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,Keflon.,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,No! Follow me.,6,S08E06,8
BANIA,"(reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Let's just replace ""hail of shrapnel"" and ""scar tissue"" with ""string of pearls"" and ""raspberry scones"".",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,George Costanza is your mentor?,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,"Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.",6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Who?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,A Mister Kenneth Bania.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,Bania?,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.,6,S08E06,8
ABBY,"Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack.",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,Cool.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,I don't want to talk about it.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Come on, don't be a baby.",6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,"I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,That's it?,6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,"Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,Mm. This food is fantastic.,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Have you tried the hamentashen?,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,I can't get off the kishkas.,6,S08E06,8
BANIA,Hey Jerry!,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Bania?,6,S08E06,8
BANIA,I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!,6,S08E06,8
JERRY,Risk management?,6,S08E06,8
BANIA,"Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.",6,S08E06,8
WOMAN,So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?,6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,That's right.,6,S08E06,8
WOMAN,How much are they paying you? I'll double it.,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.,6,S08E06,8
FRANK,Where's the powdered sugar?,6,S08E06,8
KRAMER,"You know Frank, you could take a break.",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.",6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,You're quitting?,6,S08E06,8
EDDIE,I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.,6,S08E06,8
ELAINE,"Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!",6,S08E06,8
VOICE,Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?,6,S08E06,8
GEORGE,They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.,6,S08E06,8
WILHELM,"(proudly, to the man seated beside him) He's my protg.",6,S08E06,8
FRANK,"Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!""",6,S08E06,8
JERRY,"Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"What is this, a 'bit'?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,No.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,'Cos I'm not in the mood.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(thinking) Great. Thanks.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,You know Farbman?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Mm, love Farbman.",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Brett? Don't you think that would be great?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Brett?,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"(still staring off) After the song, babe.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Huh?,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,The song.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,So when do I meet this jerk?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Who?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,What song?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Desperado.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Desperado?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Uh huh.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Uh huh.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,I invented that.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"That, had to be invented?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Elaine.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.",7,S08E07,8
CLICKY,Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,(looking at Jerry) Ohh.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.,7,S08E07,8
CLICKY,"Yeah, that's where he come up with it.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,In his dreams.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,What checks?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,Look at all of those! You're rich!,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Why?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Ah, who are any of her losers?",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,(dryly) You're on that list.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?",7,S08E07,8
EGO,"Yeah, you heard of 'em?",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Signed over a hundred checks this morning.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Hello, twelve dollars.",7,S08E07,8
MR OH,Excuse me. Would you take picture please?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,I'm gonna ask this guy something.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.",7,S08E07,8
MR YAMAGUCHI,Hai.,7,S08E07,8
MR OH,Yes.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.,7,S08E07,8
MR OH,"Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.",7,S08E07,8
MR OH,What is he doing?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.",7,S08E07,8
MR OH,He's funny.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.",7,S08E07,8
CREW LEADER,(calling to George) We're pretty much finished.,7,S08E07,8
CREW LEADER,There's just one more thing.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.,7,S08E07,8
CREW LEADER,(clears throat) You forgot to sign your check.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?",7,S08E07,8
CREW LEADER,(flat) No.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(let down) So, that's it?",7,S08E07,8
CREW LEADER,Unless you need a receipt.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.",7,S08E07,8
CREW LEADER,(flat) Good luck with that.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Hey.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,What's with the claw?,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,(to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Hi.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Ah, I'm one kind.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,The Fleckman.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,Farbman.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Right.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"No. I'm fine, thank you.",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,Don't worry. It's no charge to you.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"(walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,(quiet) Oops.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,You look like you could use a...,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,(warning) Jerry.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?",7,S08E07,8
MR OH,"(thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Why? Why d'you think he's upset?,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,(smiling) I hope not.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"Elaine, the song.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,No spiel?,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,They could've at least tried!,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,Please.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Too dumb?,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,That's right.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,How'd you hook up with these guys?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(excited) Yeah, the pilot!",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.",7,S08E07,8
TV JERRY,You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!,7,S08E07,8
TV ELAINE,"Well, why do I need your permission?",7,S08E07,8
TV JERRY,Because he's my butler.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,(eager) So? What d'you think?,7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 1,We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.",7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 1,Is this customary in your legal system?,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.,7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 1,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Are you following any of this?,7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 2,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.,7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 1,"(to Jerry and George) I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.",7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 1,(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE Again with the oranges,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.,7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs),7,S08E07,8
EXECUTIVE 1,You must go now.,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"You know, what you need is a song you can share.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,(points) I like Witchy Woman.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Witchy Woman?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Hey, man.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Hey.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Ah.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,What for?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER (O.C.),"Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,In them?!,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,You have them sleeping in drawers?!,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,This has 'international incident' written all over it.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.",7,S08E07,8
MR TANAKA,Goodnight.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Oh.",7,S08E07,8
MR OH,(sits up) Goodnight.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.",7,S08E07,8
MR YAMAGUCHI,(sits up) Oyasuminasai *(Japanese for goodnight),7,S08E07,8
JERRY,What is this?,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,(opening the fridge) Sayonara.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(leaving) Konichi-wa.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"Elaine, I...",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?,7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.,7,S08E07,8
BRETT,"Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.",7,S08E07,8
ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.",7,S08E07,8
BRETT,(flat) No. It's mine.,7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.",7,S08E07,8
MR OH (O.C.),"Ach, come back in half hour.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"(calls) Hey, I'll take one.",7,S08E07,8
CLICKY,"Well, look who's back!",7,S08E07,8
CLICKY,Teddy! (indicates Jerry) This's the guy says he invented the twirl.,7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,(unfriendly recognition) Jerry Seinfeld!,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.",7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,"(bitter) Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?",7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,"(angry) Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.",7,S08E07,8
CLICKY,"Umbrella, buddy?",7,S08E07,8
CLICKY,Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.,7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,"(to Clicky) Easy, there. (to Jerry) I hear you're taking credit for the twirl.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?",7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,(intense) I care. Clicky cares.,7,S08E07,8
JERRY,"So, could I...",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,Could I just buy an umbrella?,7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,"(sour) Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.",7,S08E07,8
JERRY,(shock) What?!,7,S08E07,8
TEDDY,"(caustically) Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.",7,S08E07,8
GEORGE,"Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.",7,S08E07,8
KRAMER,"(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?",7,S08E07,8

ELAINE,"Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.",8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,Really?,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,Well not really...,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,George...,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,Ah... (quietly),8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.",8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,"Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,Well that makes sense.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?,8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,Be my guest.,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,Good to see you again.,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,She's bluffing...,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Uhhh...,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,This is an absolute disaster.,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,Oh I don't know. Check this out.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,You stole her clock?,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Well done. (pats George on the shoulder),8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,"Yep, this one for our side!",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,You should sleep with him.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,You look a little stressed.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,You know my friend Bob Sacamano?,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,I thought he was Kramer's friend.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Forty bucks? Are they Sable?,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"No, but the difference is negligible.",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Giddee up!,8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,"It's getting cold, it's getting cold.",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,That was a close one.,8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.,8,S08E08,8
IPSWITCH,"Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is Nutria.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.",8,S08E08,8
IPSWITCH,"No, its a kind of rat.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,That's a rat hat?,8,S08E08,8
IPSWITCH,"And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors. Nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.",8,S08E08,8
IPSWITCH,And quite mad too from what I hear.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?",8,S08E08,8
IPSWITCH,No.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,So Heather called?,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,"I've looked at that, seems unlikely.",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,"Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,Hmm. That's a shame.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?",8,S08E08,8
SETH,Jerry I lied. I'm just an assistant manager.,8,S08E08,8
SETH,"(On loud speaker) Number sixty seven, family feast.",8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,"Number 67, right here, right here!",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Hello Newman.,8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.,8,S08E08,8
SETH,And don't forget your steamed broccoli.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.",8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,"I love.. broccoli, its, good for you.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?,8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,"Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)",8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,Vile weed!,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?",8,S08E08,8
NEWMAN,"Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...",8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,Oh,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,... as long as one of them is not him.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Uh-ha.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.),8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,"No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.",8,S08E08,8
JERRY,You got a little problem.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,Oh I got a big problem Jerry!,8,S08E08,8
BOY,"Here, kneel here.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,What?,8,S08E08,8
BOY,Kneel.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Kneel?,8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,Elaine.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Mr. Peterman.,8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room),8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,You speak Burmese?,8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,"No Elaine, that was gibberish.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Ah.,8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,So did you have any trouble finding the place?,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)",8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,Are you an assassin?,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,I - I work for your mail order catalog.,8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,"You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.",8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,"Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.",8,S08E08,8
PETERMAN,I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.,8,S08E08,8
ELAINE,Right... (nodding),8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,So how do you want to do this?,8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,"Alright George, I'll be honest. The first time we went out, I found you very irritating. But after seeing you a couple of times, you sorta got stuck in my head, (sings) Ca-stan-za! (like ""By Mennen"") (laughs)",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,So you - you really don't have my hat?,8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,What?,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,"Uh, le - let's go do, something.",8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,What's in the bag?,8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,"Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.,8,S08E08,8
HEATHER,"(grabs the bag) My clock, you stole it!",8,S08E08,8
GEORGE,That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,"Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.",8,S08E08,8
SETH,That's not gonna be good for anybody.,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?,8,S08E08,8
KRAMER,(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny,8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off),8,S08E08,8
JERRY,Is someone there?,8,S08E08,8

GEORGE,"Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Why are we flyin' over the Andes?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Kramer.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,So fast? What about me?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,No.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Well I would eat you.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"That's very nice, I guess.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Thank you.,9,S08E09,8

GEORGE,No.,9,S08E09,8
LOUISE,"George, I can't have sex.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,With me or in general?,9,S08E09,8

GEORGE,Nucleosis.,9,S08E09,8
LOUISE,Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.,9,S08E09,8

LOUISE,How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Six weeks?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, six weeks.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,What guys?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Like us. (Elaine enters),9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Yeah.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,So it's just mono.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,No something is bunk and then you debunk it.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,What?,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Huh?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I think. (Pause as they all look down),9,S08E09,8

KATIE,"Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry.",9,S08E09,8

KATIE,"Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Yes, all right, Katie.",9,S08E09,8

KATIE,You're the-- (He hangs up),9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,They asked you to do career day?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Yeah, it's no big deal.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,And you were integral.,9,S08E09,8
TEACHER,"Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"I'm on next, right?",9,S08E09,8
TEACHER,"Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo...",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,The guy with the lizard.,9,S08E09,8
TEACHER,"Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time.",9,S08E09,8
TEACHER,So can you come back tomorrow?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?,9,S08E09,8
BEN,"I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.",9,S08E09,8
BEN,"Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,When do you take this exam?,9,S08E09,8
BEN,I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.,9,S08E09,8

BEN,"Well, um...",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Well, can I introduce you as doctor?",9,S08E09,8

GEORGE,"It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,So you're enjoying the not enjoying.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters),9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Hey, buddy. How was career day?",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,You got bumped from career day?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"It was a mix-up, I'm sure.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,They're trying to screw with your head.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)",9,S08E09,8
LARRY,Take it outside.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Come on, Larry. You know me.",9,S08E09,8
LARRY,"It bothers people, and it's against the law.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"What, did they kick you out too?",9,S08E09,8
MAN,"Yeah, they kicked us all out.",9,S08E09,8

JERRY,Hello?,9,S08E09,8
KATIE,Jerry.,9,S08E09,8

JERRY,"Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,What is Borax?,9,S08E09,8
ALEX TREBEK,"Yes, you're right.",9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer enters)",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Ashtrays?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"No, I don't have any ashtrays.",9,S08E09,8

ALEX TREBEK,"We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Is this a repeat?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,You think?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters),9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Need some more matches.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,What is goin' on in there?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Why?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,It doesn't?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,All right.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Yeah.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?",9,S08E09,8
BEN,I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man),9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Oh my God.,9,S08E09,8
BEN,What's wrong?,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)",9,S08E09,8
SUE ELLEN,Elaine? Hi.,9,S08E09,8

BEN,No there's not.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Can't you at least tell him what to do?,9,S08E09,8
BEN,Like what?,9,S08E09,8
SUE ELLEN,Shouldn't he elevate his legs?,9,S08E09,8
BEN,Right. Elevate your legs!,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.,9,S08E09,8
LARRY,I thought he was a doctor.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Of course. Absolute zero!,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,What? What is with all these books?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I stopped having sex.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)",9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I was out.,9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,An assembly?,9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?,9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Superfreak?,9,S08E09,8
KATIE,Yes.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,What is your answer to number 74?,9,S08E09,8
BEN,Medobolic acidosis.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!",9,S08E09,8
BEN,"Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.",9,S08E09,8
JETER,Now who are you again?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.",9,S08E09,8
WILLIAMS,Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?",9,S08E09,8
JETER,We won the World Series.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,In six games.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Nine minutes.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,How am I gonna fill two hours?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table),9,S08E09,8
WAITRESS,More coffee?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?",9,S08E09,8
WAITRESS,Si,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.,9,S08E09,8
WAITRESS,Mute pragalas senor,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Eh, don't mention it.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Portuguese?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Are you all right?,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,What? What are you talking about?,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,I don't understand.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Exactly.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Hey buddy.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Hey.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Look away, I'm hideous.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.",9,S08E09,8
BEN,Pooh!,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Pooh...(laughing),9,S08E09,8
BEN,"No, it's Winnie the Pooh.",9,S08E09,8
LOUISE,"So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,So what did you do?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I told her I would have to think about it.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Simple joke from a simple man.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,So you're never gonna have sex again?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.,9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,"My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,Oh no.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Jackie we gotta talk.,9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,"No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,But Jackie--,9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,I said out.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,The who?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,The tobacco companies.,9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,I've been wanting a piece of them for years.,9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"No, it didn't say anything.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,"So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,Your face is my case.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,How ya doin'?,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Not good. I'm a moron.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,What for? Oh come on.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,I think it has something to do with me.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--",9,S08E09,8
LOUISE,"George, I have to have sex.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.",9,S08E09,8
LOUISE,"Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves)",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches),9,S08E09,8
WAITRESS,Mas Caf?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"Si, por favor.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,"Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Who could love me?,9,S08E09,8
WILKIE,"I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,"Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.",9,S08E09,8
WILKIE,"All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits)",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.,9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,Congratulations! You passed!,9,S08E09,8
BEN,"Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?,9,S08E09,8
BEN,"I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.",9,S08E09,8
ELAINE,"Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?",9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters)",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Hey.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Where have you been? You know, you're on next.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,I got lost on the way over.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Got lost? We went to school here for three years.,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"No, the Portuguese waitress.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,The Portuguese waitress?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.",9,S08E09,8
KATIE,"George, George, you're on.",9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,"No, no. I'm not going on.",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Then what'd you come down here for?,9,S08E09,8
GEORGE,Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,It's good to have you back.,9,S08E09,8
KATIE,One of you has to go on.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)",9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,She made an offer. I took it.,9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,How much?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,"No, no, no. There was no money.",9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,No money? Then what'd we get?,9,S08E09,8
KRAMER,Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it),9,S08E09,8
JACKIE,This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.,9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.,9,S08E09,8
LETTERMAN,"Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,"Actually, it was a ********.",9,S08E09,8
LETTERMAN,"those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?",9,S08E09,8
JERRY,Jerry.,9,S08E09,8
LETTERMAN,Right. Jerry.,9,S08E09,8
[Setting,Jerry's apartment],10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Gets up) Get out!,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,(Definite) Oh yeah.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,She's out.,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit),10,S08E10,8
[Setting,Manhattan Mini-storage],10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Disgusted) What is with that?!,10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?,10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.",10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?,10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.,10,S08E10,8
[Setting,George's new apartment],10,S08E10,8
RICARDI,"Excuse me, George? (H1)",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)",10,S08E10,8
RICARDI,"(Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball",10,S08E10,8
RICARDI,"No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.",10,S08E10,8
RICARDI,"Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)",10,S08E10,8
RICARDI,(Correcting) Shipwreck.,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,I remember.. (Leaves),10,S08E10,8
[Setting,Restaurant],10,S08E10,8

WAITER,"Excuse me, Elaine Benes?",10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,Yeah?,10,S08E10,8
WAITER,"An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. (Pause) He's been stabbed.",10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,(Shocked) Stabbed?!,10,S08E10,8
WAITER,More bread?,10,S08E10,8
[Setting,Jerry's apartment],10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?,10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,Did you find out who stabbed him?,10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.",10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,"Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.",10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen),10,S08E10,8
JERRY AND ELAINE,Hey.,10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.",10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?,10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,Hey.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,Hey. How's the new place?!,10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..",10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.,10,S08E10,8
ELANE,I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..,10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.",10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue),10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,How do you know?,10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"it's in my book - ""Astonishing Tales of the Sea"" 51 people died.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!",10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"There were 1,650 survivors.",10,S08E10,8
GEORGE,"That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)",10,S08E10,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah. I also got ""Astounding Bear Attacks""",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?",10,S08E10,8

NEWMAN,Sometimes we don't get what we want.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,(Confused) What are you talking about?,10,S08E10,8
NEWMAN,I didn't get my transfer.,10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"""Transfer""?",10,S08E10,8
NEWMAN,"To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,You quit the post office?,10,S08E10,8
NEWMAN,"Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.",10,S08E10,8
JERRY,"Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.",10,S08E10,8
NEWMAN,"And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.",10,S08E10,8

[Setting,Restaurant],10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,"I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)",10,S08E10,8
ALAN,"No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy.",10,S08E10,8

JERRY,Mmm.. Bad how?,10,S08E10,8
ELAINE,"(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.",10,S08E10,8

JERRY (takes out his wallet),"Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,'Kay.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY (turning to leave),Aren't you going to take the check down?,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Sorry, no. It's store policy.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,But it's your bodega.,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,Even I am not above the policy.,11,S08E11,8
BETSY,Those are our tennis courts.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?,11,S08E11,8
BETSY,"There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?",11,S08E11,8
BETSY,No.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (to himself),This prison stinks.,11,S08E11,8
BETSY,"And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,Nice to meet you.,11,S08E11,8
BETSY,I'll be in my office if you need me.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Thanks, Warden.",11,S08E11,8
BETSY (sweetly),Betsy.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (disappointed),Betsy.,11,S08E11,8
CELIA,"So, are you the head of the foundation?",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,"No, it's standard issue.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,You asked her out?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Well...not ""out."" She's a prisoner.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,How could you ask her out?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Why not?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,That was different!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I'll say.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?",11,S08E11,8
JERRY (shudders),The pop-in.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really well...",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Conjugal visit?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (giddy),Don't jinx it! Don't jinx (trails off quietly in elation),11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Hey.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Hey.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,What's up?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,George is dating a convict.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge),11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Embezzlement.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER (approvingly),"Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, not here.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.),11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I sense something is afoot.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, I bought a chicken.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Allow me. Why?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Allow me. What are you, an idiot?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry),11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Hold it, hold it, hold it, here, I got it. Catch. (Tosses his wallet to Elaine, she pays the delivery guy.)",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,What?,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.),11,S08E11,8
JERRY,(sits up in bed) Oh what...,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Hey.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry loves the morning.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Who?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Of course it is. I picked it out myself.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Well, you picked out a rooster.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,This was fun.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Yeah. I had a great time.,11,S08E11,8
GUARD,"Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.),11,S08E11,8
GUARD,I'll get that.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,Yeah. Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin),11,S08E11,8
CELIA,Hmm,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Hello?,11,S08E11,8
HELEN (in Florida with Morty),Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I'm not having money problems.,11,S08E11,8
HELEN,"Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.",11,S08E11,8
MORTY,He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!,11,S08E11,8
HELEN,That's it. I'm gonna to send you fifty dollars.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!,11,S08E11,8
HELEN,"We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY (angrily),"I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!",11,S08E11,8
MORTY,I don't see envelopes!,11,S08E11,8
HELEN,"They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you...",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,How're the folks?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Good.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,So? Movie tonight?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I thought you were going out with Celia?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Having her in jail.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,So he just shaves his head for no reason?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again),11,S08E11,8
JERRY,It's just hair.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,It's not just hair! Look!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,It's brown.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,It's chestnut with auburn highlights!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,So?,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"I'm sorry, George, but it's true.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (close to tears),I knew it.,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Hey, Kramer.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Yeah (quietly),11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,Nice rooster.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Yeah (again quietly),11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,What's his name?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs),11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Sorry Kramer, can't help you.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO (impressed),I like the way he handles himself.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Oh yeah (quietly),11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Ohhh, it's coming in already!",11,S08E11,8
KURT,Yeah (quietly),11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...",11,S08E11,8
KURT,What?,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,What do you mean? (Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.),11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?",11,S08E11,8
KURT (from the bedroom),About three years.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,Huh.,11,S08E11,8
KURT,Oh my God! (Steps into the doorway) I'm going bald!,11,S08E11,8
CELIA,George! I'm so glad to see you!,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,Good news - I'm up for parole.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,So Marcelino's going to take down the check?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Great! (realizing) What?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Ah ha...,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Only in The United States.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,It's inhumane!,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,It's two roosters peckin' at each other!,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,What?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Yeah!,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like ""American Gladiators.""",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,My Little Jerry! (Runs out.),11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,You let him fight?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,How long do they usually last?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Great!,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Hey.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Celia's up for parole.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,What?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Who?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I'm too tired.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER (to Jerry),"O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,O.K. (Kramer leaves.),11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (sadly),"It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Ah, I'm so sorry.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"In other words, a normal relationship.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Well, she'll still be an ex-con.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,It's not the same.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?,11,S08E11,8
KURT,I don't care.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,Oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,You already ate?,11,S08E11,8
KURT,It's from yesterday.,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,Now we have a new deal.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,New deal?,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO (tosses the gum on the counter),85 cents.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,85 cents? That is Outrageous!,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, that's out of the question.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"You know, I think you're jealous.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Of what?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER (points at Jerry like he's found him out),"Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Kramer, give me that rooster!",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.),11,S08E11,8
BETSY,"George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in, her getting paroled.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.",11,S08E11,8
BETSY,Does she have any plans after she's released?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,Jerry! Tomorrow night's fight-night. Where's my rooster?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Kramer won't sell.,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,You want Little Jerry to take a dive?,11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Shhh, not so loud.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO,"Can, too!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.",11,S08E11,8
MARCELINO (leaving),"Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,O.K.!,11,S08E11,8
KURT,Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (examining Kurt's head with a lamp),Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.,11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Oh, God.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,Happy? Why should I be happy?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.,11,S08E11,8
KURT,Who will I be?,11,S08E11,8
KURT,How long do I have?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (solemnly),14 months. Maybe 10.,11,S08E11,8
KURT,Is there anything I can do?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?,11,S08E11,8
CELIA,"Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out.",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE (nervously),And-and you just decided to pop in...!,11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,Kurt!,11,S08E11,8
KURT,Elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) Will you marry me?,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Hey, Kramer...?",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Be careful.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Hey.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Is that good?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,I don't know. Where have you been?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -",11,S08E11,8
JERRY (interrupts),"George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.)",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" time...",11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Plus, you want to get to know me.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah, that too.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Well, how much time?",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?,11,S08E11,8
KURT,"No, no, no...it has to be now.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?,11,S08E11,8
JERRY (to Elaine),"So, you're actually considering it?",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?",11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Hey.,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Sorry I'm late.,11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Where's Celia?,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,"She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,hmm. (nodding head),11,S08E11,8
JERRY,"Hey, how's he doin'?",11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.",11,S08E11,8
JERRY (opens the envelope),Fifty dollars. I Don't Believe This!,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.),11,S08E11,8
JERRY,Look at the size of his bird!,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.,11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,"No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.",11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Ah, damn.",11,S08E11,8
DETECTIVE #1 (to Kurt),"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza. Well, well, well. Look who's here.",11,S08E11,8
CELIA,"Aw, man!",11,S08E11,8
DETECTIVE #2 (to Kurt),"Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a known fugitive.",11,S08E11,8
KURT (laughs),I'm not George Costanza.,11,S08E11,8
DETECTIVE #2,Save it. We know you're bald. We know it's you. Let's go! (They escort Kurt and Celia out.),11,S08E11,8
ELAINE (to a woman at the fight),"Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!",11,S08E11,8
JERRY,He's a ringer!,11,S08E11,8
GEORGE,Where's the tamale guy?,11,S08E11,8

ELAINE,Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!,11,S08E11,8
KURT,"They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I, slugged him.",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,"So, how long are you gonna be in here for?",11,S08E11,8
KURT,"Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?",11,S08E11,8
ELAINE,(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.,11,S08E11,8
KURT,Yeah.,11,S08E11,8
KRAMER,"Well, that was alright, huh?",12,S08E12,8

KRAMER,"Well, um, goodnight.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,Goodnight.,12,S08E12,8
(Kramer rolls over to go to sleep. The bedside clock reads 12,30. Emily snuggles up to him and puts an arm around him. Kramer doesn't look comfortable with this.),12,S08E12,8
(The clock reads 3,"31. Kramer is lying on his back, sleeping. Beside him, Emily lies face-down, sleeping, with her arms flung out wide. One hand is on the pillow above Kramer's head, then it moves and Emily's forearm runs across Kramer's face, waking him. Kramer looks disgruntled at being awakened.)",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(quietly, to himself) Look at this.",12,S08E12,8
(The clock reads 5,"11. A wide awake Kramer is right over to the edge of the bed, with Emily cuddled up to him, sleeping happily. Kramer tries to carefully move, so as to not wake Emily, but as he shifts his weight, he slips off the end of the mattress and falls to the floor. Emily rolls into the space vacated, continuing to sleep.)",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Jerry, we can only stay four days.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Helen, did you pack my travel gym?",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any doorknob.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Am I finally getting a baby brother?,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Jerry, be serious.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,What? The Cadillac I bought for you?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"It's too much car, Jerry.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,I don't think we even use it.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,We already sold it.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,(exasperated) Ugh.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Kramer.,12,S08E12,8

HELEN,Hi Kramer.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,Hiya Kramer.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,We're in the middle of a discussion here.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,Oh yeah? What about?,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,What'd you get for it?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,Jack Klompus gave us six grand.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,(getting worked up) I don't need the money.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be, what with def jam and all.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, that def jam is a force.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales' executive training program.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,I'm going to the bathroom.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Just, very interesting.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.",12,S08E12,8
COUNTERPERSON,Arabian mocha java?,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,That Arabian is strong coffee.,12,S08E12,8

GEORGE,Yeah.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Bye.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Mmm.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,You see what just happened here?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,What?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,And you misinterpret this how?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,You're crazy.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,George.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(angry) Stickin' it!,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,So you're buying the car back for your parents?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Your parents'll never let you do it.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,What kind of money you think your parents have?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Excuse me?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,I bet they have more money than mine.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Come on, your parents have money.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,You think?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,When did they ever spend any money?,12,S08E12,8

JERRY,Where do they ever go on vacation?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Nowhere.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,How much money d'you think they have?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Few hundred grand?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Course you may not see it for twenty years.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Twenty years? That long?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"Fortunately, yes.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,How's your family history?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,I have an aunt that died at seven.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Really?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Aunt Baby.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, Kramer, come on in.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(unsure) Oh-kay.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Ah.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(confused) Jimmy legs?,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,Jimmy leg.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(grasping the concept) Ohh.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Well, I'd say it nicely.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,I don't think so.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(impatient) Get out!,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,You just heard about this today?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,Who cancelled?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Is that common in our family?,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,Also internal problems.,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and then one day, they're all gone.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her!,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,I guess you two are the lucky ones.,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,So far.,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,She'd never make it.,12,S08E12,8
EMILY,So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking...,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Shh, shh.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"(quieter) Well, do you?",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me?",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,I don't know.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"You're not easy, Kramer.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,I know.,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,I wanna buy back the Cadillac.,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?",12,S08E12,8
JACK,I'm kidding.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.",12,S08E12,8
JACK,Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,You bought it for six!,12,S08E12,8
JACK,You're not me.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,(standing) How much d'you want for it?,12,S08E12,8
JACK,The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Fourteen thousand.,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to Naples.",12,S08E12,8
JACK,Need a pen?,12,S08E12,8
JACK,Still works.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Hey, where's Jerry?",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,You know that number?,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"F. F, E, L , D.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,He's not there?,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"No, they never heard of him.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,Where's Jerry?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,(surprised) President?,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Yeah.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"Hey look, he's back.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.",12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Mom? Dad?,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Wh..what're you doing here?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,We're having an upscale dinner.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,What?,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time left.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,"So, we're blowing it all.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,"(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,That was alright.,12,S08E12,8
EMILY,Yeah.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(abruptly) Well, I'll see you.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Hello.,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with the car.",12,S08E12,8
JACK,I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,(quiet) Huh. Alright.,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,Who was that?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,I'd have to go back to work.,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,Where would you work?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,Maybe I should talk to Elaine.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,What's not to understand?,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,I don't have it. I'll mail you one.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"You sell clothes here, don't you?",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Yeah.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine...",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Uhm...,12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,Who's Mr Fancy?,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,(surprise) What?,12,S08E12,8
EMILY,You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone. (pause) And you scream in your sleep.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,I do?,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"C'mon, it was probably the wind.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"(adamant) Well, I do.",12,S08E12,8
JACK,What took you so long?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"This thing is a, is a behemoth.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,What did you do?,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.",12,S08E12,8
JACK,(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,My car? You drove it into the swamp!,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,That's your mother's new car.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,You bought that?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,It's a Coupe de Elegance.,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,Mornin'.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Oh, boy.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,What the hell is going on here?,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.",12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have been talking.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(dread) Oh god.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,"(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her old position, at her original salary...",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a job... done.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?,12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,I think not.,12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,What?,12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,(puzzled) Who are you?,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Don't worry, I...",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"Elaine, did you hire this man?",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(pointing out the positive) But happy.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,Obviously.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,What?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,You schedule a late meeting.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,That's right. That's me on the left.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"So, you sleep in separate beds.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,"Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,(intrigued) Really?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,You can get that in your arms?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,Like you wouldn't believe.,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all your phone calls. Why are you still here?",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...",12,S08E12,8
JACK,"You are uh, thinking of staying here?",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,Well...,12,S08E12,8
JACK,"(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,You didn't like that crack about the pen.,12,S08E12,8
JACK,I did not.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,"(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.",12,S08E12,8
FRANK,It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving tonight.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,We were just being nice.,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,"(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here alone?",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,"He's not family. It's different, psychologically.",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we at least get some food here?",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's close to finish with his story.",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.",12,S08E12,8
PETERMAN,"(winks) Morty, you're out.",12,S08E12,8
MORTY,"(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.,12,S08E12,8
EMILY,(not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,(dismissive) Yeah.,12,S08E12,8
EMILY,"(still reading) Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's tomorrow night.",12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,You like 'em.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,I've had it with 'em.,12,S08E12,8
EMILY,Then we won't go.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,"(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?",12,S08E12,8
EMILY,Eight thirty.,12,S08E12,8
KRAMER,(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(downcast) Yeah.,12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(Jerry-style) That's a shame.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(innocent) What?,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,I think you're sticking it to me.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,You're not alone. I'm practically broke.,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Really?,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.,12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Well, you seem happy.",12,S08E12,8
GEORGE,I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!,12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,"So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?",12,S08E12,8
JERRY,"Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.",12,S08E12,8
ELAINE,Hmm.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,When are we gonna tell Jerry?,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.,12,S08E12,8
MORTY,He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting away with that.,12,S08E12,8
HELEN,"Besides, that condo was too much house.",12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,How many times can you check the car?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day.,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!,12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,(shouts) You're driving me crazy!,12,S08E12,8
FRANK,"(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands) Where's my hat?",12,S08E12,8
ESTELLE,(shouts) Nooh!,12,S08E12,8
BILL,"Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the one to tell him no.",13,S08E13,8
REILLY,No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.,13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?",13,S08E13,8
REILLY,"Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?,13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,Oh. That's not quite the same.,13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,I'm gonna grab a can of balls.,13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,Right.,13,S08E13,8
MILOS,Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,I need a can of balls.,13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...",13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, went straight to video.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,(positive) That makes me the premiere.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,(gets Kramer's point) Hah.,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,No.,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Can you do that for me, buddy?",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Well, I'm gonna type it up.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)",13,S08E13,8

ELAINE,Who is it?,13,S08E13,8
VINCENT (O.C.),It's Vincent.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Of Vincent's picks?,13,S08E13,8
VINCENT (O.C.),The same.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,He called you?,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.,13,S08E13,8
PLAYER (O.C.),"Little help, hey!",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,(tossing the ball back) Yeah.,13,S08E13,8
PLAYER,Thank you.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,George used up all my guest passes already.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Ah.,13,S08E13,8
PLAYER,Ahh.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,Come on.,13,S08E13,8
PLAYER,Thank you.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,(tossing the ball) Here you go.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,(disbelief) Milos?,13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"(shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing?",13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,So he was bad. What d'you care?,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,The executor? Of what?,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,Kramer wants to die with dignity.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,There's a feather in your cap.,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?,13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Who's Reilly?,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.',13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,(confused) What does that mean?,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...",13,S08E13,8
GEORGE,"(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,(indicating) You see? You can't let go.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Me?,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.",13,S08E13,8
SHELLBACH,"Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're conscious, but with no muscular function.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Well, would I be able to communicate?",13,S08E13,8
SHELLBACH,I don't see how.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.,13,S08E13,8
SHELLBACH,"Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no central nervous system.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.",13,S08E13,8
SHELLBACH,"Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Naw, that's not my style.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Bore-ing.,13,S08E13,8
SHELLBACH,"Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,(hesitant) Uhm...,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,I'd stick.,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,Hello Milos.,13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm, listen...",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.",13,S08E13,8
MILOS,I..I...,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,You can't even play.,13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,You could do that?,13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"Jerry, for you, anything.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?",13,S08E13,8
MILOS,"(apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...",13,S08E13,8
MILOS,Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you.,13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.",13,S08E13,8
JERRY,"Tennis, anyone?",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"That's a lotta yearning, huh?",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Really?,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box),13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, I could use a chuckle.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,(approving) Yeah.,13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,What're you getting?,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Oh. How much you got left?,13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, about two hours.",13,S08E13,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,"(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!",13,S08E13,8
ELAINE,Hello.,13,S08E13,8

GEORGE,(quiet) Uh-oh.,15,S08E15,8
KRAMER,"We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.",15,S08E15,8
GEORGE,Can't we discuss this?,15,S08E15,8
KRAMER,(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!,15,S08E15,8
GEORGE,(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!,15,S08E15,8

PEGGY,"Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.",15,S08E15,8
ELAINE,"(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!",15,S08E15,8
PETERMAN,"Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.",15,S08E15,8

GEORGE,"You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Yeah.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,How many years of med school did you have?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Was she mad?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,You didn't tell her.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word),16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I'll take fastidious.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,What is that?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.",16,S08E16,8
HEAD,Holy cow!,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Just the last few innings of a double-header.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Why didn't you pull over?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.",16,S08E16,8
HEAD,Holy cow!,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,China Panda.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, I'd like to place an order.",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,"Ah yes, what you like?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,What number?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Forty-seven.,16,S08E16,8
OWNER,"Yeah, first time. What else?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Uh, that's it.",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,Address?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,"That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,I'm not below.,16,S08E16,8
OWNER,Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Your guy can't cross to my side?,16,S08E16,8
OWNER,"If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street, Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,"Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary. (slams down phone)",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,(picks up phone) China Panda.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.",16,S08E16,8
OWNER,"Ah, what you like?",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well, I'm a poppa.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Aw, looks just like you.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,That old scam.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,Quality time.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Keys. I can't find my keys.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Have you seen 'em?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,No.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Dammit!,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,Right.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,So?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,So you can't duplicate 'em.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?",16,S08E16,8
DELIVERY BOY,(suspicious) Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,I... thought that I would meet you halfway.,16,S08E16,8
DELIVERY BOY,You really live here?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,You didn't look down?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,No! No!!,16,S08E16,8
HEAD (O.C.),"Holy, Holy Cow!",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Poor son of a bitch.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,It's like I'm holding a blender.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,"(restarting and reapplying the brush) Really, it does?",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,(shouting to Jerry) I was really happy with my old toothbrush.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA (O.C.),That stuff tastes like bleach!,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I don't know anything about that.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,That's the idea.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,"Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,You still couldn't kiss her?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Jer, do you see where this is going?",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Being really clean and happy?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Disorder?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Shall we stop and say hi?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Nah, we've seen it.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Yeah.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.",16,S08E16,8
MAN,Yeah?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?",16,S08E16,8
MAN,Wha? What d'you want?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.",16,S08E16,8
MAN,"Wh, when is that?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.",16,S08E16,8
MAN,Who are you with?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.",16,S08E16,8
MAN,Who let you in?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,What's with the signs?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Hey. So, keys?",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I guess they leave that up to the general population.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Hard to say.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Really?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Yeah?,16,S08E16,8
JENNA (O.C.),It's Jenna.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,You think you could hook me up with these guys?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Seven-eight-four.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Hey.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Hi.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,How you feeling?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,What?!,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,What?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I'm sorry.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,When were you gonna tell me this?!,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Obviously never.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,I need the yield sign.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,You could've introduced me.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I wouldn't know where to start.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Gotta run.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Oh, man!",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,She won't even give you a hint?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Yes, that is a definite possibility.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Are you just screwing with me?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, I am.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,Hey ah.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Hey, how's life on the road?",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I don't doubt it.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,What's this?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Isn't that some kind of safety thing?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,What the hell are you talking about?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,How are you gonna widen the lanes?,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,One-Q? Whose apartment is that?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"That's the janitor closet, across the street.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Now, where's that tool shed of yours?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,I'll see you.,16,S08E16,8
RALPH,You Costanza?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.",16,S08E16,8
RALPH,What're the keys doing in there?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.",16,S08E16,8
RALPH,You put 'em in there?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.",16,S08E16,8
RALPH,Bad place to put your keys.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?",16,S08E16,8
RALPH,"Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?",16,S08E16,8
RALPH,Yeah. (snorts) It's about money.,16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER,"'Scuse me, what are you doing in there?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.",16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER,"You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)",16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER,Don't get smart with me.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(meek) Yes ma'am.,16,S08E16,8
RADIO,"Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly, for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Oh it's you.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Is the flounder here yet?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(gesturing) There's this.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(gleeful) The fish!,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Ah, what're you doing here?",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Hey.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Hey.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,"Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Kramer's guys?,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.",16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,Ow!,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Uh, man!",16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,I'm plumb out.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!",16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER (O.C.),Janitor?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?",16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER,I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Yeah, I am so sorry.",16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER,Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Well, a lot of it is vegetable...",16,S08E16,8
MRS ALLISTER,"Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here. Understand?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(meekly) Yes ma'am.,16,S08E16,8
GEORGE,...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I don't feel like eating.,16,S08E16,8
KRAMER,"(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,"So Jerry, why'd you call me?",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,"Yes, I did.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Well, whatever. So, how've you been?",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Good.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Good. (pause) Steak knife?,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Just eating away at you isn't it?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Nah.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Hi.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Hi.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Hi.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,For what?,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Well, actually it's pretty grimy.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.",16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,"Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Sure. Bye.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Bye.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Bye.,16,S08E16,8
ELAINE,Bye.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Toilet brush.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,You wanna order dinner?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,That's true.,16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Mm.,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.",16,S08E16,8
JENNA,Do you hear something?,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,I don't know what that could be.,16,S08E16,8
HEAD,Holy cow!,16,S08E16,8
JERRY,"Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.",16,S08E16,8
JERRY,Holy cow! Have a nice life.,16,S08E16,8

ELAINE,Yeah.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.",17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,So?,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.,17,S08E17,8

KRAMER,Yeahh. I owe you one.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Maybe he has money.,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.",17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,"So, what d'you wanna see?",17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?,17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,(indicating another poster) How about The English Patient? It's up for all those Oscars.,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,"Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.",17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,It's a family in a brown paper bag.,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?,17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,No.,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.,17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,"(to the booth guy) Oh, two for The English Patient.",17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,"So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?",17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,(smiling back) Hi.,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?",17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,"Oh, no. He got held up at work.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.",17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,"Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,(disappointment) Oh. Course not.,17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,"No, you're a little taller.",17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,"(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about ""The English Patient, it's so romantic"". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!",17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,I kinda liked it.,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,(firm) No you didn't.,17,S08E17,8
CAROL,"Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?",17,S08E17,8

JERRY,"You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.",17,S08E17,8
MORTY,"Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this.",17,S08E17,8
MORTY,See that? You couldn't do that.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"I could, but I choose not to.",17,S08E17,8
SID,Hey Morty. (nodding toward Jerry) Who's this?,17,S08E17,8
MORTY,"This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(protesting) I..I didn't say that.,17,S08E17,8
SID,"(calling over) Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.",17,S08E17,8
IZZY,"Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.",17,S08E17,8
SID,That's not so funny.,17,S08E17,8
IZZY,"(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?",17,S08E17,8

IZZY,(drawn out) Aaaahh.,17,S08E17,8

BLAINE,"(cold) Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.",17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,It's just a stupid movie.,17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,(to Carol) That's what I'm talking about.,17,S08E17,8
CAROL,"(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.",17,S08E17,8
BLAINE,(bitter) Enjoy Sack Lunch!,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,(fierce) I will!,17,S08E17,8
HELEN,(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(defensive) He egged me on.,17,S08E17,8
HELEN,You should be more mature.,17,S08E17,8

JERRY,"Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?",17,S08E17,8
GUILLERMO,What cigars?,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.,17,S08E17,8
GUILLERMO,(indicating the threesome) We are the Cubans.,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!",17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Cigars!,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?,17,S08E17,8

KRAMER,Damn!,17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.",17,S08E17,8

DANIELLE,"(flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?,17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,(inviting) Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.,17,S08E17,8

WAITRESS,Rough night?,17,S08E17,8

WAITRESS,Really? I thought it was pretty good.,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,"Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!",17,S08E17,8

IZZY,What are you doing here?,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.",17,S08E17,8
IZZY,What the hell is that?,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,What?,17,S08E17,8
IZZY,That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?,17,S08E17,8
MORTY,This was a gift from my son.,17,S08E17,8

JERRY,"(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"I don't know, but you better keep it up.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.",17,S08E17,8

KRAMER,"Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,What?,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,So?,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,What's the difference?,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(confused) We're talking about people, right?",17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,I thought they smelled pretty nice.,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, your palate's unrefined.",17,S08E17,8

PETERMAN,"Elaine, what'd you think?",17,S08E17,8

IZZY,"Uh, oh, wait.",17,S08E17,8
IZZY,"How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(humouring him) That's very nice.,17,S08E17,8
IZZY,The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better than just number one.,17,S08E17,8

IZZY JR.,"(to Jerry) Hey, who are you?",17,S08E17,8
IZZY,This is Seinfeld's kid.,17,S08E17,8
IZZY JR.,"Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? (squaring up to Jerry) Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(jocular) You got any kids?,17,S08E17,8
IZZY JR.,"Oh, you think you're better than me? (challenging) Go ahead, pick out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.",17,S08E17,8
IZZY,(pointing) The television.,17,S08E17,8

KRAMER,They're right out here.,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.",17,S08E17,8
HAFFLER,"You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now, would you?",17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.",17,S08E17,8
HAFFLER,"(confusion) We're talking about people, right?",17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,(puzzled) I think so.,17,S08E17,8
HAFFLER,I thought he quit smoking cigars.,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.",17,S08E17,8

KRAMER,Over there. The Dominicans.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,So?,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.",17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.",17,S08E17,8

JERRY,(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.,17,S08E17,8
IZZY,"Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up.",17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?,17,S08E17,8
IZZY,Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the magic in Magic Pan!,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,"(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?",17,S08E17,8
IZZY,Yeah.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.,17,S08E17,8

ELAINE,The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Tunisia?,17,S08E17,8
ELAINE,That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.,17,S08E17,8

KRAMER,These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?",17,S08E17,8
DANIELLE,"I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.",17,S08E17,8

DANIELLE,(concerned cry) Neil!,17,S08E17,8
JERRY,Why are the crepes spraying?,17,S08E17,8
KRAMER,"(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?,17,S08E17,8

DANIELLE,"George, I can't move in with you.",17,S08E17,8

DANIELLE,"I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.",17,S08E17,8
GEORGE,"(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!",17,S08E17,8

JERRY,"So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.""",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,So what're you gonna do?,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,Thought it would be nice.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Poor Beth.,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"Hey, Arnie's just as upset.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Oh screw him! (George enters),19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,"Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex.",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.,19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,Really?,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,But you yada yada'd over the best part.,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"No, I mentioned the bisk.",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,"Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"Well, I gotta do somethin'.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,George is already in there.,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,I thought you were leaning towards Julie.,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,Well it was a helluva yada yada.,19,S08E19,8
MARCY,"He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,"All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.",19,S08E19,8
MARCY,Okay.,19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,Tell me about the free facial.,19,S08E19,8
MARCY,"Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,Which one?,19,S08E19,8
MARCY,Bloomingdale's.,19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,Very good. Go on.,19,S08E19,8
MARCY,"Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,What's that?,19,S08E19,8
MARCY,"And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,Shoplifting.,19,S08E19,8
MARCY,"Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause)",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Excuse me, Mother?",19,S08E19,8
NUN,Sister.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?",19,S08E19,8
NUN,Well not until tomorrow.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Hmm, I really need to speak with him.",19,S08E19,8
FATHER,That's a kneeler.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Oh. (Adjusts accordingly),19,S08E19,8
FATHER,"Tell me your sins, my son.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.,19,S08E19,8
FATHER,That's no sin.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.",19,S08E19,8
FATHER,And this offends you as a Jewish person.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.",19,S08E19,8
FATHER,Well.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.",19,S08E19,8
FATHER,I haven't heard that one.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys."" (Father starts laughing) Father...",19,S08E19,8
FATHER,"One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?,19,S08E19,8
FATHER,Um...,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Newer magazines.,19,S08E19,8
FATHER,Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.),19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,"Jerry, I gotta talk to you.",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,Hi.,19,S08E19,8
KAREN,"Hi, Kramer.",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,Got a minute?,19,S08E19,8
KAREN,"Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,Sure.,19,S08E19,8
KAREN,"(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,Hi.,19,S08E19,8
ARNIE,"Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there?",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....",19,S08E19,8
ARNIE,"All right, shut up!",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,Again you are telling me to shut up?,19,S08E19,8
ARNIE,What?,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.,19,S08E19,8
ARNIE,Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.",19,S08E19,8
ARNIE,"All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"(In pain) Oh, are you about done?",19,S08E19,8
TIM,I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Huh?,19,S08E19,8
TIM,Father Curtis told me about your little joke.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,What about all your Jewish jokes?,19,S08E19,8
TIM,"I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,The Jews?,19,S08E19,8
TIM,"No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Date with Karen?,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"No, Julie. She's the one.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,What happened to Karen?,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"Those people, listen to yourself.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,What?,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Kramer, he's just a dentist.",19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,I am not an anti-dentite!,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,"You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,They do have their own schools!,19,S08E19,8
KRAMER,Yeah!,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,"One little baby, whatever you have in stock.",19,S08E19,8
AENT,Miss Benes...,19,S08E19,8

BETH,"Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Well, what's wrong?",19,S08E19,8
BETH,I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Talk to me.,19,S08E19,8
BETH,"He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.",19,S08E19,8
BETH,But we just got married.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.,19,S08E19,8
BETH,Why would Elaine do that to me?,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)",19,S08E19,8
MICKEY,Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,I'm kinda in the middle of something.,19,S08E19,8
MICKEY,Karen and I are getting married.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.",19,S08E19,8
MICKEY,(To Beth) How many is that for you?,19,S08E19,8
BETH,Two.,19,S08E19,8
MICKEY,"You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Beth and Arnie broke up.,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,So they don't want a baby?,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,(Shaking his head no) Pff.,19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone),19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Hey, where's Marcy?",19,S08E19,8
GEORGE,"She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Hey, Kramer, over here.",19,S08E19,8

JULIE,"Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Hi, Mr. Abbott.",19,S08E19,8
MR. ABBOTT,"That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard.",19,S08E19,8
BETH,What was that all about?,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,"Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.",19,S08E19,8
BETH,"Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?",19,S08E19,8
JERRY,What?,19,S08E19,8
BETH,A dentist. (They laugh),19,S08E19,8
JERRY,That's a good one. Dentists.,19,S08E19,8
BETH,"Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile)",19,S08E19,8
ELAINE,Where's Beth?,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,She went out to get her head shaved.,19,S08E19,8
FATHER,We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony.,19,S08E19,8
JERRY,Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.,19,S08E19,8
FATHER,"Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward exit)",19,S08E19,8

ELAINE,(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.,20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,(into phone) So? What else is goin' on?,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,(shouts) HEY!!,20,S08E20,8

VALERIE,Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny.",20,S08E20,8

GEORGE,"Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,What for?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(thoughtful) I have no idea.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,I don't mind the Mayans.,20,S08E20,8

KRAMER,"(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.",20,S08E20,8
MINKLER,"George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and we think that someone might be you.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(surprise) Head of scouting?,20,S08E20,8
MOONEY,Interested?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(playing it cool) I'm still here.,20,S08E20,8
MINKLER,"Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer while you're still under contract.",20,S08E20,8
MOONEY,You understand what we're talking about?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,So you're talking...,20,S08E20,8

MINKLER,...we couldn't say that we said it.,20,S08E20,8
MOONEY,You see what we're saying?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?,20,S08E20,8
MINKLER,(serious) We didn't say that.,20,S08E20,8

GEORGE,...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Good meeting?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,You can do that.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"So, George...",20,S08E20,8

JERRY,So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"What, she's ranking you?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,What is a barometer exactly?,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,It's pronounced thermometer.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"(pleased) Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner, and the play, and the hansom cab ride.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,Oh.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,I'm gonna go put these in some water.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,I like the way you think.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.",20,S08E20,8
WILHELM,Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,Is it? (reaches into bag),20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,Gotta get the good ones.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Oh, that's bad. That's bad.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Some of us.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hola.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,Shove it!,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,What is all this?,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.",20,S08E20,8

KRAMER,Newman?,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,Yeah.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hi Valerie.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,You're not Valerie.,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,I'm her step-mother. Drive.,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"But, I never...",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,(threatening) You just stay away from that phone.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"You wanted to see me, sir?",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,"...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation needed.",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,"We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you make of that? Hey, check this out. (he stands to reveal he's wearing baseball pants) Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. (a thought occurs) Hey, you don't think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em off. I'm too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his boxers) Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,"Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,You deserve it.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"My stepmother got to you, didn't she?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,What? No.,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the speed-dial completely!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Yikes!,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,I have done nothing unethical.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,(thoughtful) What kind?,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Cubed.,20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.,20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,How could they not fire you?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,Never thought I'd fail at failing.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Aw, come on there now.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Nonsense. You do everything wrong.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(hopeful) Everything?,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Everything.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,You really think so?,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,That's the spirit. You suck!,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,(pleased) I know.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.",20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,Do you need some help with something?,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?,20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,I own this store.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously),20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,I'm Gladys Mayo.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"Ah, this really sticks in my craw.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"I'm sure she'll be along. (handing over a glass) Have some wine, Jerome.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Okay.,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So attractive, so strong, so comedic.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Uh, good.",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,(nervous) What?,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Valerie's not coming over, is she?",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"Seven, four...",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,No...,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,Two...,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,I won't tell if you don't.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,(yells) Newmanniun!!,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,(whimper) Jerry?,20,S08E20,8
KOREN (O.C.),"Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short stocky bald man is streaking across the field.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Oh my God, George!",20,S08E20,8
KOREN (O.C.),"Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems upset.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Kramer, look, it's George.",20,S08E20,8
KOREN (O.C.),Everyone loves him.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,(neutral) Fine.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,(neutral) No problem.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.",20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,(neutral) Okay.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.",20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,(neutral) Fine.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,(neutral) Alright.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.",20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Yeah.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Can do.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,What're you doing with a pricing-gun?,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,(to himself) Still a rip-off.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hello?,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her speed-dial.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hold on a second.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hello?,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,(seductive) Hi Jerome.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hello?,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"That's her on the other line, isn't it?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Well...,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hang on.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"I won't, until she puts me back on hers.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hang on.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,She wants to be back on yours.,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,Fine. But only if you're off hers.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hang on.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Fine, if I'm off yours.",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"No, still me.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Sorry. Hang on.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Fine, if I'm off yours.",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,"I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.",20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,(conspiratorial) Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency buttons.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"(hurried) Great, bye.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,She said she'll do it.,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,Great.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hang on.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hello?,20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,Jerry. I can't get fired.,20,S08E20,8
FAN,"Hey, body-suit man. 's up?",20,S08E20,8
FAN,"(pointing) Hey, body-suit man.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native.

GLADYS,"Well, lemme show you what we have.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?",20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,Yeah.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Hmm-mmm.,20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,Some of those are women's clothes.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Oh, not a problem.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,L'Occupado.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"Come on, what is taking you so long?",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.",20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,Plan B? There is no plan B.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,What?!,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.",20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,That's not gonna do anything.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Patience.,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,Alright. Forget it!,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,What?,20,S08E20,8
ELAINE,"You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!",20,S08E20,8
GLADYS,"Ladies, care for some chips?",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,"I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...",20,S08E20,8
WILHELM,"Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me.",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,"What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again?",20,S08E20,8
WILHELM,"No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,Macho head games?,20,S08E20,8
WILHELM,"(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.",20,S08E20,8
STEINBRENNER,"Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak on. (rising) Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. (heads toward the door) Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem.",20,S08E20,8
GEORGE,"Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!",20,S08E20,8
WILHELM,"I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets.",20,S08E20,8
WILHELM,"(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,She never sees the big picture.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Hello, Newman!",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail.,20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"Alright. Come back to my party, please.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,"Jerry too, of course.",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,No.,20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine.",20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,Deal?,20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand),20,S08E20,8
KRAMER,(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?",20,S08E20,8
NEWMAN,"(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Aww!,20,S08E20,8
MRS HAMILTON,I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,I'll call for help.,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hello?,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,Who's this?,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,It's Jerry. Who's this?,20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"Uh, it's Valerie.",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?",20,S08E20,8
VALERIE,"I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the button for poison control and I get you!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,"Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!",20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hello?,20,S08E20,8
JERRY,Hang on just let me pick up a paper.,21,S08E21,8
MAN,Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Yeah. No problem.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Let's go.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,For how long?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,I'm sure he'll be back in a second.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Come on.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,21,S08E21,8
MAN 2,Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll ever come back?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Where are you going?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,I'm going to be this guy's friend.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,New clothes?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,The guy never came back.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,He asked you to watch them not wear them.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,I'm still watching them.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,You look like a tourist.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,When you hear like a soft russeling.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Oh right, the new job, how is it?",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,So who's the new you?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Oh hi Alex.,21,S08E21,8
ALEX,I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,No.,21,S08E21,8
ALEX,I'll be right back.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Thanks. Thanks a lot.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Hey.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Hey.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Hi.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Where's Jerry?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Well let's sit down.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Vaguely.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,You put my life's stories in his autobiography?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.",21,S08E21,8

KRAMER,Hey buddy. Remember me?,21,S08E21,8
MR. PETERMAN,You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?",21,S08E21,8
WOMAN,Who are you?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,I'm the real Peterman.,21,S08E21,8
MR. PETERMAN,All right playtime's over.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.,21,S08E21,8
WOMAN,I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,So you just eat the tops.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.,21,S08E21,8
MAN 1,Try looking up hayseed.,21,S08E21,8
MAN 2,You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Well actually I'm...,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"Little Rock, Arkensas.",21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,Ooh.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Hmm. That looks new.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,What's the matter with you?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,(uncomfortably) Nothing.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,I did something stupid.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,What did you do?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Well women do it.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"(high pitched voice) ""Well women do it."" I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Well what am I going to tell Alex?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Um hum.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Hey!,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,I forgot. Wait. Never mind.,21,S08E21,8
ALEX,How about the beach this weekend?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...,21,S08E21,8
ALEX,"All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Really?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"""Top of the Muffin to you!""?",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Mr Lippman?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,So you're pretending to be a tourist?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,How do you explain your apartment?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,I got a hotel room.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,you moved into a hotel?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,So?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Reality tour?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,This was my idea you stole my idea.,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,You want a muffin or not?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Peach.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,So I notice you don't have much of an accent.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,"Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Willie. Yeah.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,And I'm still going to be here.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,"(laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,What is it she think you can't do?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Find a job. Get an apartment.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,How did you do those things?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Here you go, here you go, check it out.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,What's desert?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,He eats those?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Talk to me.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Understand?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,So? What do you want me to do about it?,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,"You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Yeah.,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,So what do we with the bottoms?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,That's a good idea.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*""",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,No. No. It is.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,What? Can't I get a moment's peace?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,What are you doing to yourself?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Oh that's an old wives tale.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Is it? Look at this.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.,21,S08E21,8
LIPPMAN,"Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.",21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,"Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Oh, hi.",21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,You been enjoying them?,21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,They're just stumps.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Well they're perfectly edible.,21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,"Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,"No no, we just thought...",21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,"I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.,21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,The homeless don't like them.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Fine.,21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,"We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?""",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,We were just trying to help.,21,S08E21,8
REBECCA,Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,I think I might.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"$2,300.00 ",21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,Ouch. A month?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Yeah.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,"Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.",21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.",21,S08E21,8
WOMAN,"Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.,21,S08E21,8
MAN 1,Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.,21,S08E21,8
MAN 2,Who's Newman?,21,S08E21,8
MAN 3,Who cares.,21,S08E21,8
MAN 4,"Hey fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nautious.",21,S08E21,8
MAN 1,Can I have his candy bar?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Why do I have to go on the tour?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Hey, how's business?",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,"Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?",21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Yeah.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,You got any room on that thing?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Yeah there are a few seats still available.,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.",21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,No they don't.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Are they war veterans?,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,Wow this is your office.,21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,"Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out.",21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,"Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.",21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave),21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,Wait a minute George.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.,21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,"Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the ""o""'s) Bloooooooooooooooooooown.",21,S08E21,8
ALEX,"You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,You also shouldn't use a donut.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...,21,S08E21,8
TAPE PLAYER,Turn music off.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Can we just go?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,And go we will.,21,S08E21,8
MAN,What is this? A piece of pound cake?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.,21,S08E21,8
MAN 2,We're going to a garbage dump?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,And we're off.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.",21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,(the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.,21,S08E21,8
JOHN TYLER,(the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.,21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?,21,S08E21,8
JOHN TYLER,"How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.",21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,How do you make that alcoholic chicken?,21,S08E21,8
JOHN TYLER,"Let if ferment, just like everything else.",21,S08E21,8
MR. STEINBRENNER,That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.,21,S08E21,8
MAN,Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,I was going to dump this.,21,S08E21,8
MAN,It doesn't look like garbage.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Well it's muffin stumps,21,S08E21,8
MAN,Where are the muffin tops?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.,21,S08E21,8
MAN,Can't do it.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Is this a joke?,21,S08E21,8
MAN,That's what I'd like to know about it.,21,S08E21,8
ALEX,"You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,What's that?,21,S08E21,8
ALEX,Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,Oh. Yeah.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.",21,S08E21,8
MAN,Where are we going?,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,"(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.",21,S08E21,8
WAITRESS,"So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,"Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.",21,S08E21,8
MAN,"Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?",21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,What clothes?,21,S08E21,8
MAN,These clothes. The ones you're wearing.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.",21,S08E21,8
JERRY,I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,I don't know where the tops are.,21,S08E21,8
KRAMER,Jerry what's the matter?,21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.",21,S08E21,8
BARTENDER,"Hey, you looking for George?",21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,Yeah.,21,S08E21,8
BARTENDER,He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.,21,S08E21,8
GEORGE,(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.,21,S08E21,8
MARY ANNE,I told you this city would eat you alive.,21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,What is this guy again?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.,21,S08E21,8
NEWMAN,Hello Elaine. Where are they?,21,S08E21,8
ELAINE,In the back.,21,S08E21,8
NEWMAN,"All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.",21,S08E21,8
MR. LIPPMAN,What is going on here?,21,S08E21,8
NEWMAN,"If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.",21,S08E21,8
"(Newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets down a cooler and an empty glass. From the cooler he takes out 4 bottles of milk and sets them down. He bites into a stump, then takes a drink of milk from the glass. (continuity error",he never actually poured the glass of milk.) He swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows. He takes another stump.),21,S08E21,8
JERRY,"Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,I got to give the players most of the credit for that.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"No, I don't know who was doing that.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.,22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,"Here you go. Your latt, your cappuccino.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Maybe I should ask her out?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,She is a good waitress.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,You're going to the Tony's?,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?',22,S08E22,8
JERRY,They're musicians. That's not a joke.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,It's a funny observation.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,They did it for three years. What's another few months.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,I'm really going to do something with these three months.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Like what?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,I've always wanted to do that...,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,I'm gonna play frolf.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,You mean golf?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!",22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,Who's that?,22,S08E22,8
DUGAN,"That's Sam, the new girl in the counting.",22,S08E22,8
WALTER,What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis.,22,S08E22,8
DUGAN,She walks like orangutan.,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,Better call the zoo.,22,S08E22,8
DUGAN,Reer...,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,What?,22,S08E22,8
WALTER,ssssss...,22,S08E22,8
DUGAN,Cat-ty...,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Like this? (imitates the walk),22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Yes, exactly.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,That's so strange.,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?",22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,That is so stupid.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Reer.,22,S08E22,8

GEORGE,How do you know it was her dude?,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,What do you think it could've been just some dude?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,I reckon.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Dude!,22,S08E22,8

JERRY,It's 1030 in the morning?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,I tell you; I'm wiped.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?",22,S08E22,8

ELAINE,"Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.",22,S08E22,8
SAM,"No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more.",22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"See, yeah, that's all I was saying.",22,S08E22,8
SAM,"How's this (Sam hits a pen case out of the table), or this (swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right).",22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Hi!,22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,"Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,No rush.,22,S08E22,8
LYLE,"Hey, Jerry! What's up?",22,S08E22,8

JERRY,I can start right away.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,But not here. (They leave.),22,S08E22,8
JERRY'S ANSWERING MACHINE,"'I'm not here, leave a message.'",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.",22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.",22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,"Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'.",22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Hey, eh, Lew!",22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,We need to talk.,22,S08E22,8
PETERMAN,"Elaine, what did you want to talk me about?",22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,This. My office. Sam trashed my office.,22,S08E22,8
PETERMAN,"Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight.",22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.",22,S08E22,8
PETERMAN,Woof!,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Do you mean ""reer?""",22,S08E22,8

JERRY,"Ok, ok...",22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,Do you mind?,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"No, I'll crab it.",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Hey, I've done that today.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"What, did you lose your remote?",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Not.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"No, no...",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"No, because that's...",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Here.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,I'm trying.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!,22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual production.,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,No.,22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless...,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,Anything...,22,S08E22,8
MALCOLM,"Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch?",22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, she's fantastic....",22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,She's a train wreck.,22,S08E22,8
MALCOLM,There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover.,22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,It is a gut wrenching scene.,22,S08E22,8
MALCOLM,"But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. It's very distracting.",22,S08E22,8
MR. GRAHAM,There's lot of this (swings his arms) in tap dancing.,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?",22,S08E22,8
MALCOLM,"No, we want you to fire her.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,She seems very nice.,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,I'm in show business.,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,Yayaya...,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.",22,S08E22,8
SAM'S VOICE,Elaine...I am going to find you. If not in your office then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the kitchen...,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Did you tell Peterman about this?,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.",22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,Cat fight?,22,S08E22,8
ELAINE,"Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?",22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,Yeye cat fight!,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,T-t-t-t...,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,You got the tickets?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,I like it.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,What?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,A little notice would've helped! How many people?,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"35, and George, on the invitations...",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...",22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,"Right on time, I like that.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"I like your nails, that is a great color.",22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,Love the sweater.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,This old thing?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Hi, I need some party invitations.",22,S08E22,8
CLERK,"Okay, have you been in here before?",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,About a year ago. Wedding invitations.,22,S08E22,8
CLERK,"Right, how did that all work out?",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,No complaints.,22,S08E22,8
CLERK,"Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.",22,S08E22,8

KRAMER,"Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.",22,S08E22,8
RAQUEL,"Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! (hangs up) Kids! You're still here.",22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.",22,S08E22,8
RAQUEL,What kind of problem?,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...",22,S08E22,8
RAQUEL,Out with it!,22,S08E22,8
KRAMER,"Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...",22,S08E22,8
GUY,Little help?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Hey, frolf?",22,S08E22,8
GUY,"Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in?",22,S08E22,8
(George looks up and sees Jerry on the other side and frisbee on the other. Jerry says,"""What's the deal with airplane peanuts?"")",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, sure.",22,S08E22,8
GUY,"Ok, come on.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"Ok, let's towel it up.",22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,"Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they don't go out today they're useless.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,But we're in towels.,22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,Jerry.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,all right. One second.,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)",22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,Hello.,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!",22,S08E22,8
LANETTE,Did you shave your chest hair?,22,S08E22,8
JERRY,No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?,22,S08E22,8
GEORGE,"Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.",22,S08E22,8
JERRY,"Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.",22,S08E22,8

ELAINE,Aren't you Raquel Welch?,22,S08E22,8

DOCTOR,"Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.",22,S08E22,8

KRAMER,Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.,1,S09E01,9

KRAMER,I'm shaving with it.,1,S09E01,9
JERRY,Oh Moses smell the roses.,1,S09E01,9

GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!",1,S09E01,9
JERRY,How can you do this?,1,S09E01,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.",1,S09E01,9
JERRY,He drove a car with no arms?,1,S09E01,9

GEORGE,You miss her.,1,S09E01,9
PUDDY,"(to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.",1,S09E01,9

ELAINE,This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.,1,S09E01,9
PASSENGER,(hereon known as Vegetable Lasagna) I can hear you.,1,S09E01,9

GEORGE,So what do you care what she thinks.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Good body.,3,S09E03,9

LLOYD,"(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,What is Lloyd Braun doing here?,3,S09E03,9
FRANK,Your mother recommended him.,3,S09E03,9

FRANK,I didn't read his resume.,3,S09E03,9
LLOYD,"(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board.",3,S09E03,9

ADAM,Are you free Friday night?,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.",3,S09E03,9
ADAM,But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.",3,S09E03,9
ADAM,"Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First, they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion!",3,S09E03,9

FRANK,Serenity now!,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!",3,S09E03,9
FRANK,I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles),3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.",3,S09E03,9
ADAM,"(Storming out of the room) Well, that does me a lot of good. 'Early 20s'!",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.",3,S09E03,9
LIPPMAN,"So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her),3,S09E03,9

PATTY,How about La Caridad again?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?,3,S09E03,9
PATTY,"Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!",3,S09E03,9
PATTY,Maybe I should just leave.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,'Maybe'!?,3,S09E03,9
PATTY,Good-bye!,3,S09E03,9

ELAINE,"Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Whoa. What is the matter?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,It's Patty.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Oh my God. You're crying.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,This is horrible! I care!,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,I don't know what's happening to me.,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,What?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"I love you, George. Come here.",3,S09E03,9

JERRY,Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?",3,S09E03,9

GEORGE,"If I do it, will you buy a computer?",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"On the signal, George. On the signal.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"I love you, Costanza.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Will you shut up?!,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,What?,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,It means a non-Jewish woman.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Oh, that's insane.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,I am not buying a computer from you.,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,There's porn.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,(Pausing) Even so.,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Damn it!,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.",3,S09E03,9
LIPPMAN,That's simply not true.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.",3,S09E03,9
LIPPMAN,You are wrong. I'll prove it.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Oh, no. Don't!",3,S09E03,9
LIPPMAN,I renounce Judaism!,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Oy vey!,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"What happened to you, pal?",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Are you all right?,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,Serenity! (He exits),3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"Sit down, Elaine.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Do you have an apple or anything?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,What?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Elaine...,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,I'm asking Elaine to marry me.,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Elaine?,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Lippman?,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Can I help you?,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,No. Stay! Stay. Stay.,3,S09E03,9
FRANK,"Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?",3,S09E03,9
FRANK,"Costanza, you're white hot!",3,S09E03,9
PHONE,"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--",3,S09E03,9
FRANK,"Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the same you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!",3,S09E03,9
ESTELLE,You're not gonna give away that water pik!,3,S09E03,9
FRANK,"You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!",3,S09E03,9
LLOYD,"You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you blow.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,What do you know? You were in the nut house.,3,S09E03,9
LLOYD,What do you think put me there?,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,I heard they found a family in your freezer,3,S09E03,9
LLOYD,Serenity now. Insanity later.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"What happened here, Kramer?",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Serenity now, serenity now...",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Kramer!,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,You don't look well.,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?",3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?,3,S09E03,9
KRAMER,"(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,All right... here goes...,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?",3,S09E03,9
RABBI,"Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North American cousin, the Sasquatch.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.",3,S09E03,9
RABBI,"Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?",3,S09E03,9
RABBI,"You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"Yikes. Well, good look with all that.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,I think you scared me straight.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"All right, Jerome, I'm in.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,What?,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"I tell ya, I don't see it happening.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,What? What happened to the new Jerry?,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,He doesn't work here anymore.,3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Oh, well that's just *great!*",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"I love you, Jerry.",3,S09E03,9
JERRY,"(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.",3,S09E03,9
ELAINE,"Well, that's because you're an idiot.",3,S09E03,9
FRANK,You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy.,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?,3,S09E03,9
FRANK,He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell.,3,S09E03,9
ESTELLE,I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in!,3,S09E03,9
FRANK,This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now!,3,S09E03,9
ESTELLE,All right...,3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,"Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.",3,S09E03,9
FRANK,"So, what am I supposed to say?",3,S09E03,9
GEORGE,'Hoochie mama'?,3,S09E03,9
ESTELLE,"Move your crap, I'm comin' in!",3,S09E03,9
FRANK,No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!,3,S09E03,9
JERRY,Are you sure you can't stay longer?,4,S09E04,9
MORTY,"No, we just came for the funeral. `",4,S09E04,9
HELEN,"Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,He was 96 years old.,4,S09E04,9
MORTY,"That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.",4,S09E04,9
HELEN,That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.,4,S09E04,9
MORTY,And every morning I eat a plum.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.",4,S09E04,9
HELEN,What about you?,4,S09E04,9
MORTY,"Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Really?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Hey, Seinfelds!",4,S09E04,9
MORTY,"Hey, Mr. Kramer!",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,How long are you staying?,4,S09E04,9
HELEN,We just came down for a funeral.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...",4,S09E04,9
HELEN,See you downstairs with the car.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?,4,S09E04,9
MORTY,"No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Did you give blood?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,In case of what?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Are we finished?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Done.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Yeah...,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,You haven't seen Jimmy for years.,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Tomorrow evening, sure.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Do you know anyone responsible?,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Do I know anyone??,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,What are you doing?,4,S09E04,9
TARA,"Incense, for the mood.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Um, cream soda?",4,S09E04,9
TARA,Vanilla.,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,You just left? What did you tell her?,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What?,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"I don't know, I was starving Jerry!",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Oh, pudding! You want some?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Elaine, what do you think?",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.",4,S09E04,9
BANK EMPLOYEE,"Well, we can transfer to another bank for you.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"So eh, what do you say?",4,S09E04,9
TARA,I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...",4,S09E04,9
TARA,"Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?",4,S09E04,9
TARA,No.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Didn't go for it, huh?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,No.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What the hell is that?,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Pudding skin singles.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh, why?",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,I closed down my account at the blood bank.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"What, it...it's here in the building?",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Hey, working out?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,You know it and I ditched all my junk food.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,What the heck is going on here?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Is this about me?,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,No.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh, then I lost interest.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,You? I'm more responsible than you are!,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Oh, Tara!",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Kramer...,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Don't take my money!,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"No, I'm the baby-sitter.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Elaine? What are you doing here?,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.),4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,There was an incident.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Would you stop it.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What is this?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,It's Jell-O.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What about this? This is blood isn't it?!,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Heads up!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Aaah...,4,S09E04,9
JIMMY,"You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead!",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,I wish I was dead.,4,S09E04,9
JIMMY,Can I have your juice?,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,As long as you don't put...,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Thanks for the re-fill.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Hey, Elaine! How did it go?",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Oh, he's...he's a joy...",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"It's not serious, is it?",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Aah!,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,I can see that! What happened?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,I'll remember that.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Three pints of Kramer's blood?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Well, so much for purification week.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"So, how's the fornicating gourmet?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"George, we're trying to have a civilization here.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Hey.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Hey, how was baby-sitting?",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Really?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,I'm not touching that thing.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh, no...",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Hello?,4,S09E04,9
HELEN,"Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Kramer called you?,4,S09E04,9
HELEN,He calls every week. Are you all right?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Yes, I'm fine.",4,S09E04,9
HELEN,He says he's fine.,4,S09E04,9
MORTY,Tell him to eat a plum.,4,S09E04,9
HELEN,"Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.",4,S09E04,9
MORTY,Plum...(Jerry hangs up.),4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Why are you calling my parents?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Why here?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Ok...,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Fine...,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Ok!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Blood!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,All right.,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Hello, dough boy.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Elaine? Elaine?,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Where's Jimmy?,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?",4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Don't get puss honey, and pick up that medicine ball.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?",4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,For what?,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,All aboard in the pain train!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,How many session did my parents paid for?,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!",4,S09E04,9
TARA,"Oh, George!",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.),4,S09E04,9
TARA,George? George? What are you doing?! (Pulls the covers off. George is eating a sandwich and watching TV.),4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Pleasuring you?,4,S09E04,9
[5A. Kramer and Newman are making sausages. Tape recorder plays Jackie Davis,Manana. Jerry comes in.],4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What is this?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,We're making sausages.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,I thought you were gonna watch a video.,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.",4,S09E04,9
IZZY,Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"So, the free love buffet is over?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What's going on?,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,I think you're right. You gonna eat that?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,These fries are really really good...,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Uuh, sleepy.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,Why did you get rid of that sausage?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What's wrong with yours?,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) ""If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, I can't do that.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Oh, mama...",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Vivian...,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Elaine!,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Hi! This is my friend George.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Hi...,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Ok.,4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,(whispering to George) You're up.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Really, why?",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Her grandparent passed away five years ago.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,That's because it's underwater.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,This is insane.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Is it?,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Yes it it.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,You...very knowledgeable.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?",4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Very.,4,S09E04,9
VIVIAN,"Oh, wait...(Vivian turns the TV on.) Oohh...",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Vivian!!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Is this really necessary?,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What if I can't keep up?,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.",4,S09E04,9
IZZY JR.,"Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...",4,S09E04,9
IZZY & IZZY JR.,"Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...(Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking)",4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What's going on?,4,S09E04,9
IZZY JR.,There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something on my feet. Some kind of red liquid.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh my God, the blood!",4,S09E04,9
IZZY JR.,Blood!!,4,S09E04,9
IZZY,"Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,So how long did they drag you?,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.",4,S09E04,9
ELAINE,Hi George. Hi Jimmy.,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.",4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,Ouch!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,What's the kid doing here?,4,S09E04,9
GEORGE,I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Oh, that's a drag...",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,That kid...,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,You put blood in the car?!,4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.",4,S09E04,9
JERRY,"Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.",4,S09E04,9
KRAMER,You didn't get the blood from me.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Then who?,4,S09E04,9
NEWMAN,Hello Jerry.,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,Aaaaahhh...!!!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY & KRAMER,Aaaahhh...!!!,4,S09E04,9
"JERRY, KRAMER & NEWMAN",Aaaaahhh...!!!,4,S09E04,9
JERRY,(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Who was it?,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Why? He's harmless.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,I made him up.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,No.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Too bad. It was erotic.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,'Pottery Barn'?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Why don't you just throw 'em out?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,So call now.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,That's him.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Is he still nuts?,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'",5,S09E05,9
PUDDY,"(finishing eating) Seriously, is this the best okra you've ever had, or what?",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,Mmm. De-lish.,5,S09E05,9
PUDDY,Delish?,5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Delish. You know, short for delicious.",5,S09E05,9
PUDDY,"Oh, like scrump.",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,Yeah.,5,S09E05,9
PUDDY,(leaving) I'm gonna be late. See ya later.,5,S09E05,9
JACK,"Excuse me, can I borrow your ketchup?",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure.",5,S09E05,9
JACK,Thank you.,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,(answering the phone) Hello?,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"Hey, it's Georgie.",5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,Let me put your father on the phone.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Ma!,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,Who is this?,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.",5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,"(feigning a Chinese, muffled voice) Chinese food.",5,S09E05,9
FRANK,"(hanging up) Sorry, George, our Chinese food just came. Talk to you later.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Chinese food?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"So, maybe they had Chinese food?",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Stop the mail?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,That's... even better!,5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,Jerry!,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,This is it.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Inside the van?,5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,"It is the van! Don't you remember, we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive?",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,We were ten.,5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,Come on. Let's take it for a spin.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,I don't want a van.,5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Always helpful.,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,"Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.",5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,Uh... the phone broke.,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,"Well, we got to get moving.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,What? Where are you going?,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,We have a catered affair.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,You're going like that?,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,"(leaving the kitchen) It's creative black tie. Move, woman.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.,5,S09E05,9
JACK,"Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.",5,S09E05,9
JACK,I'm gonna be in the can.,5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?",5,S09E05,9
CASHIER (Ruthie Cohen),Sure.,5,S09E05,9
Elaine,"(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,"(in the van with Jerry) Nice captain's chairs, huh?",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Aye, aye.",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,"Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.,5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,"No, that's us.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,You don't like the van?,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"No, no, no. Just hypothetically.",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,I gotta go to the park.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Where'd you get the bricks?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, the whole building is brick.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,OK.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,I don't want to trade.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)",5,S09E05,9
POSTAL EMPLOYEE,May I help you?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.",5,S09E05,9
POSTAL EMPLOYEE,Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.",5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,"I'll handle this, Violet. Why don't you take your three hour break? Oh, calm down, everyone. No one's cancelling any mail.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Oh, yes, I am.",5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,What about your bills?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,The bank can pay 'em.,5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,The bank. What about your cards and letters?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.",5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,"All right, it's true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.",5,S09E05,9
SUPERVISOR,"Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman?",5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,"Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,Oh!,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Quick for a... catered affair.,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,I don't know what you mean.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,"George, we've had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son, but even parents have limits.",5,S09E05,9

JERRY,"Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?",5,S09E05,9
ELAINE,"Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.",5,S09E05,9

KRAMER,(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,You want to trade me an undershirt?,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.",5,S09E05,9

JERRY,Are you insane? Give 'em to me.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.",5,S09E05,9

KRAMER,What?,5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,"You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but I'm telling you as a friend. Here's how it's going to happen you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,Are you through?,5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,No! And no one will ever see you again!,5,S09E05,9

GEORGE,"Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?",5,S09E05,9
RHISA,Geor-gie...,5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,(running up to the van and yelling through the window) Is this Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?!,5,S09E05,9
RHISA,(hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van) Wait. What's he saying?,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!",5,S09E05,9
RHISA,"No, they caught him.",5,S09E05,9

JERRY,"(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,You hate the van.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,"So, can we go for a ride?",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Yeah, let's just get out of here.",5,S09E05,9
HOLE DIGGER #2,"(eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it) Are you done with that?",5,S09E05,9
FRANK,(coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,(looking inside of the van) Wow!,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,"(reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!",5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?",5,S09E05,9

POSTMASTER GENERAL,Last time I checked.,5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,Henry... can I get out of here now?,5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,Oh?,5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,Yeah.,5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,Yeah! Ha ha.,5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"I'm very, very sorry.",5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,Sure do!,5,S09E05,9
POSTMASTER GENERAL,"(receiving a salute from Kramer) Now, that's better.",5,S09E05,9
KRAMER,"(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?",5,S09E05,9
NEWMAN,(whimpering) Tell the world my story.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Hey, George!",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!",5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Oh. The summer me.,5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,The winter me.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,You must be George's cousin.,5,S09E05,9
RHISA,Girlfriend.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,All right.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,Don't go a-knockin'.,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,"(after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,"(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!",5,S09E05,9
FRANKIE,Now you gotta sell this van.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,"Oh, yeah.",5,S09E05,9
FRANK,What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.,5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Ohhhh...,5,S09E05,9
ESTELLE,Your father's right. It's beautiful.,5,S09E05,9
FRANK,And it was safe.,5,S09E05,9

FRANK,"Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...",5,S09E05,9
GEORGE,Oh... make it stop.,5,S09E05,9
JERRY,I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Oh, no.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"All right then, what was it?",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Ya broke my blender, didnt ya?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,I knew it.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Why were you making gravel?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Aahh, this looks familiar",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Of course. It's garbage.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Come on, Kramer, get out of there.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,(moans) Ohhh (walks away),6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?",6,S09E06,9

GEORGE,So uh where we eating?,6,S09E06,9

JERRY,Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys),6,S09E06,9
CELIA,Oh yeah the toys.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Where did you get all these?,6,S09E06,9
CELIA,My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.",6,S09E06,9
CELIA,"Jerry, what are you doing?",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.,6,S09E06,9
CELIA,Ohhh Jerry. (takes them from Jerry and puts them back with the other toys) They're priceless. They've never been played with.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"I just want a, touch em a little.",6,S09E06,9
CELIA,I said no. Now come here.,6,S09E06,9
LOU,"Hi (startled, Elaine spills her coffee on her sleeve) I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?",6,S09E06,9
WALTER,uh-He's Lou Filerman. He's new here.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,(exhales),6,S09E06,9
WALTER,Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,You've been an enormous help.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,You ran over some pigeons? How many?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So Miranda's cooled on ya?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,I'm getting nothing.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Yeah, me neither.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,I don't understand women.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Here comes one.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Hey. What's going on?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"No, Castro.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Right.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So he just sidles up?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry),6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Maybe you just didn't see him.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from ""The Lion King"".",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Hakuna Matata?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,I thought I was alone.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,That doesn't make it right.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Would you just, let it go?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Hey! (moving a chair onto the set),6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Oh my God!,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times),6,S09E06,9
JERRY,How did you get this in here?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So where you gonna sleep?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Yeah ... backstage.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain),6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)",6,S09E06,9

PETERMAN,"One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Yeah, that was me.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,An Army Pete.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Right.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Jerry. Oh there - -,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Kramer, what is wrong with you?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,What do you mean?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!,6,S09E06,9

TAPE RECORDER,Turn Music Off (Kramer pushes the off button turning the music off),6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, sit, sit, sit Weeell! (laughing, clapping)",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Well, it happened again.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,What happened?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,That was the wrong card.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So they're like everyone else.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.,6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,Then why don't you just run IT over too?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Zing.,6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,"George, what are you doing?",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!,6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel. (leaves the car),6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!",6,S09E06,9
CELIA,Jerry! (she slides away from him)  Those hands! They never stop!,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!,6,S09E06,9
CELIA,No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,All right.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Ohh, will not cause drowsiness""",6,S09E06,9
LOU,Here's the new copy you wanted.,6,S09E06,9
PETERMAN,"Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down),6,S09E06,9
PETERMAN,"Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)",6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,Doctor is the squirrel going to live?,6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Well, uh, are there any other options?",6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"We, could put him to sleep.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,What might that cost?,6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.",6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Yeah. yeah. I-I know.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,El Paso? I spent a month there one night.,6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,(laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,What's he here for?,6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,eue-aaa.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,Are you married right now? (points at Jerry),6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm),6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,I told you he was a risk.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,"Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Smile, everyone! We're back!",6,S09E06,9
LOU,"You wanted to see me, Elaine?",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...",6,S09E06,9
LOU,My dead tooth?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,No. Your. (breathes),6,S09E06,9
LOU,Not my breath?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Uuhhh.,6,S09E06,9
LOU,What can I do?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.",6,S09E06,9
LOU,"Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! (he opens the door and goes into the hall - now he clicks and clacks when he walks)",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine),6,S09E06,9
CELIA,Hmm. (takes a sip),6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.",6,S09E06,9
CELIA,What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY and GEORGE,Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script),6,S09E06,9
CELIA,Ahh.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.),6,S09E06,9
CELIA,What video did you get?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Oh.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Four hours.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,More heavy gravy?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,"Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label I can hardly tell the difference.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,We got no one!,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.,6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,What about a guest-host?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,I'll pretend I didn't hear that.,6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,"Doctor, how's the squirrel?",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Is he dead?,6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?",6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,Yes he would.,6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"So ... uh, squirrel.",6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,What's that?,6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,He has no home. He's a squirrel.,6,S09E06,9
DOCTOR,"Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"What about my ""questionable material""?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" is coming to your apartment?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Well, I practically raised his kids.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,Tic-Tacs work?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,He's a human maraca.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,You took him over to Celia's?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,What? It's a victimless crime.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Okay, one victim.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,I think it's unconscionable.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,EZ Bake oven?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Who wants cupcake?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Oh, me, me, me, me, me!",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.",6,S09E06,9
FRANK,(on TV) You step on it and it flushes.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?,6,S09E06,9
ESTELLE,(on TV) Stop squirming.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,You're like eight years old.,6,S09E06,9
ESTELLE,(on TV) Georgie.,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,I was seven and a half.,6,S09E06,9
PETERMAN,That noise. That's the noise!,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,What?,6,S09E06,9
PETERMAN,"That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!",6,S09E06,9
PETERMAN,That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,No Mister Peterman.,6,S09E06,9
PETERMAN,"Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.,6,S09E06,9
LOU,"Oh, right.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.",6,S09E06,9
LOU,Why?,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Because they're turning your teeth green?,6,S09E06,9
LOU,I only buy the white ones.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.",6,S09E06,9
LOU,I can't. It burns my cankers.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Binaca?,6,S09E06,9
LOU,Again.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!",6,S09E06,9
LOU,I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that 20 years ago.,6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.",6,S09E06,9
FOWLER,Where are the cameras? (he has a live Hawk perched on his arm),6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"And she doesn't know anything, about this?",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"No, not a thing.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!",6,S09E06,9
CELIA,What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?,6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN & KRAMER,Woah.,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"What, What is this? What is she doing here?",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.,6,S09E06,9
CELIA,"If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN,Go girl!,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,"Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?",6,S09E06,9
NEWMAN and KRAMER,Ohhh!,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,George I told you we're booked!,6,S09E06,9
FOWLER,Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Uh.,6,S09E06,9
FOWLER,"No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,(off camera) Are we getting this?,6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So the whole set was destroyed?,6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,"Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.",6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.",6,S09E06,9
KRAMER,Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.,6,S09E06,9
MIRANDA,"I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. (exits)",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,So the squirrel's gonna make it?,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.",6,S09E06,9
JERRY,On the couch? So you're...,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,Still getting nothing!,6,S09E06,9
GEORGE,So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!,6,S09E06,9
CELIA,"I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?",6,S09E06,9
CELIA,Who's he? (Lou),6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,"Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)",6,S09E06,9
ELAINE,Hey.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Morning.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,But why?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,I need some space.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Does that mean I have to go too?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,You don't think she's just talking to me?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Hey, shut up.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,You shut up.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,I hate this.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"No, I don't want this anymore.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,We'll come to work with you.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,And on your dates.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,And shopping.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,And to the bathroom.,7,S09E07,9
"JERRY, GEORGE & KRAMER","Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!,7,S09E07,9
(Elaine tries to push her alarm clock showing 3,"30. She realizes, that alarm comes from next door.)",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams),7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"You won't regret this, sir.",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,I don't care. Let's find you an office.,7,S09E07,9
(Kruger leaves and George notices a photograph on the table,Kruger's family and George on the background.),7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,The boom box incident?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Seems reasonable.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Even more reasonable.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,And that guy is your new boss?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Yeah.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Like retouched.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Neither have I.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Hey, our meat problems are solved.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Where did you get this thing?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Hey.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, that's pretty good.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Sara Sitarides?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Mmhu.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Oh...(falls in to the sofa.),7,S09E07,9
JERRY,What's with you?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Your whole building smells like potatoes.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,How do you do that?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,I think we might have one left in the stock room.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,This hallway smells like potatoes.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,I think I'll let you do it.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"No, I really don't want to.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, I don't want to either.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,I thought you had done this before.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,It's just...it's no picnic.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Well, how are we gonna do it?",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,Oh mama.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Are you okay?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,I will lose that nail.,7,S09E07,9
SARA,I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Well, I have this neighbor...",7,S09E07,9
SARA,A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?,7,S09E07,9
SARA,No.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Cause I hit a whopper last week!,7,S09E07,9
CLERK,"Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.,7,S09E07,9
CLERK,I thought you said you wanted to be out?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!",7,S09E07,9
CLERK,You've really lost a lot of hair.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,I am aware!,7,S09E07,9
Elaine thinking,"Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,The cat.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,He took out Kruger?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,This slicer is indomitable.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Where did you get that butcher's coat?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,What did he do about it?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Oh, that's a prickly one.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, how's the doctor date?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Dermatology?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Yes, she's a dermatologist.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"The slicer! Elaine, let's go.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Where are we going?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,When are you going on your next date with her?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Oh, what's the point?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Flowers?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"So, you've done this?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,I think we are looking half a millimeter.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Can it cut that thin?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,How did you know you cut it?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, I guess I just assumed.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, that's a hall of famer.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Alright, let's do it.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Oh no, I don't think so.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Why not?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, you're not checked at on it.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,What do I have to know?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, where the meat goes?",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Right there.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,Where do you turn it on?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Right there.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,But where does the meat go?,7,S09E07,9
SARA,"Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?",7,S09E07,9
SARA,It's fine.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!",7,S09E07,9
SARA,What is with you?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!,7,S09E07,9
PARRY,Dr. Sitarides?,7,S09E07,9
SARA,"Mr. Parry, how are you?",7,S09E07,9
PARRY,I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,She saved your life?,7,S09E07,9
PARRY,I had skin cancer.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Skin cancer! Damn.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.),7,S09E07,9
CLERK,Here you Mr. Costanza.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,What is this? This is a drawing.,7,S09E07,9
CLERK,"Looks real, doesn't it?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,This is a cartoon!,7,S09E07,9
CLERK,"Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!",7,S09E07,9
CLERK,Then you better get a camera.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,He looks like a Peanuts character.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,You can do that.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Without his shirt on.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,It seemed so disorganized.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,I understand.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"True. You mean, for you?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,I think.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,What about your sea sickness?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Maybe I could be a land guy.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,I don't know if they have land guys.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Pliers?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Drawer.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Got it.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,What are they for?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Come again?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Eh, it went okay.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Yeah, I started out real classy...",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Yeah you did, you classed it up!",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,But then I found out about the skin cancer.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Oh, so it backfired?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Yeah.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Aha.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Could she do that at Kruger?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"I don't know, I guess.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,You have a little thing for this fella'?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Must I?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,How does that reflect me?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Ok, I'll go with you.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...",7,S09E07,9
SARA,"Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Was it pimple popper MD?,7,S09E07,9
SARA,That's the one. (Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.),7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Still got it.,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Out, damn heal!",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,Elaine?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Kramer?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Just hold on!,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)",7,S09E07,9
NEIGHBOR,"Hey, get the hell out of here!",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,What the hell is this?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,No.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, what have you been doing?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"There, there's your hives.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"What, she gave me hives?",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,She did kind of touch my face.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Oh, that's fantastic.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.",7,S09E07,9
SARA,What record?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"His personal file, I, I don't ask...",7,S09E07,9
SARA,Jerry? What brings you here?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)",7,S09E07,9
SARA,Looks like hives.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Where do you suppose that could've come from?,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, what are you doing...",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,He is just setting the record straight.,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?",7,S09E07,9
SARA,Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"I want the antidote, pimple popper!",7,S09E07,9
SARA,"That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Doc, huh?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,This is it. I can take this anymore.,7,S09E07,9
(She turns the radio on loud (Foghat,"Slow Ride) and ""dances"" few little kicks.)",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"So, how am I looking?",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Kramer, I really owe you one.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"George, we got a problem.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,What?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Because, you're not a dermatologist.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Whoa, whoa, a section?!",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,No! Absolutely Not!,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.",7,S09E07,9
[Elaine is on the phone and the radio plays music very loud (Iron Butterfly,In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida)],7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!",7,S09E07,9
NEIGHBOR,Turn it off! Turn it off!,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!",7,S09E07,9
NEIGHBOR,"Alright, that's it!",7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, the address is 78th West...",7,S09E07,9
NEIGHBOR,"Oh, oh mama...",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"So, Kramer pulled it off?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Why don't you see someone about it?,7,S09E07,9
JERRY,I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,I don't want this on my conscience.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, alright...",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, that's weird.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,What are you doing?,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.",7,S09E07,9
JERRY,"Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)",7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,"Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,I'm not too worried about it.,7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,Whatever.,7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,"Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!",7,S09E07,9
KRUGER,"Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.",7,S09E07,9
GEORGE,That's what they tell me!,7,S09E07,9
KRAMER,Do you want more pastrami?,7,S09E07,9
ELAINE,"Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.",7,S09E07,9

JERRY,"Well, technically he did apologize.",9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!",9,S09E09,9
JERRY,"So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?",9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,That's right. I'm two in the hole!,9,S09E09,9
JERRY,"Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.",9,S09E09,9

PETERMAN,"I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.",9,S09E09,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.",9,S09E09,9

SPONSOR,Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?,9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,"I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.",9,S09E09,9
SPONSOR,I'm not sure what you want me to do.,9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,"Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.",9,S09E09,9
SPONSOR,"You're quite upset, George.",9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,"Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.",9,S09E09,9

JERRY,"Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--",9,S09E09,9
ELAINE,Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.,9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,Why not? It's a good look for a woman.,9,S09E09,9
ELAINE,"Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.",9,S09E09,9
JERRY,So you don't think it's attractive?,9,S09E09,9
ELAINE,"It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.",9,S09E09,9

PUDDY,"Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.",9,S09E09,9
KRAMER,No. It says 'main line'.,9,S09E09,9
PUDDY,"It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?",9,S09E09,9
KRAMER,Yeah.,9,S09E09,9

PUDDY,(showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.,9,S09E09,9
ELAINE,What is this symbol?,9,S09E09,9
PUDDY,It's a germ.,9,S09E09,9
PEGGY,"Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs.",9,S09E09,9
PUDDY,Don't you? Elaine.,9,S09E09,9
PEGGY,(flinching away) Please!,9,S09E09,9
PUDDY,I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.,9,S09E09,9
PEGGY,Really?,9,S09E09,9
PUDDY,I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.,9,S09E09,9

MELISSA,I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.,9,S09E09,9
JERRY,"Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...",9,S09E09,9
KRAMER,"(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?",9,S09E09,9

JERRY,So what are you up to?,9,S09E09,9
KRAMER,"Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?",9,S09E09,9

GEORGE,"(ready to leave) Well, thank you.",9,S09E09,9
HANKE,You're welcome.,9,S09E09,9

HANKE,Waffle or sugar cone?,9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,"Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.",9,S09E09,9
HANKE,What?,9,S09E09,9
KID,Can you get on that cone?,9,S09E09,9
HANKE,"Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?",9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,"Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.",9,S09E09,9
KID,Is there anybody else here but you?,9,S09E09,9
HANKE,"I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?",9,S09E09,9

HANKE,"I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice.

HANKE,Please. Step Nine.,9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.,9,S09E09,9
GEORGE,It wasn't funny.,9,S09E09,9
HANKE,"It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck.",9,S09E09,9

GEORGE,"God, you're like a rock star.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Because you threw it out.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,But you did actually throw his coat out the window.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,But that's you.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,Look at you. You're on a slant.,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Here, just give me a couple of napkins.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"There, there I'm fine.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,What was that?,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,I think I had some hard candy in there.,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Ahhh. How does this thing work?,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Ahhhhh...,12,S09E12,9
DELIVERY MAN,"Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Ahhhhh...,12,S09E12,9
KERI,Ready to go?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.,12,S09E12,9
KERI,You don't go that often?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?",12,S09E12,9
KERI,Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Compact, lipstick, all this?",12,S09E12,9
KERI,And can you help to carry my keys?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"What are you, a medieval dungeon master?",12,S09E12,9
KERI,And a tin of altoids.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Ow! Sharp key.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Well, there's very little sleeping going on.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Well, why didn't you tell me about this?",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Hey, what is that up that tree?",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,The Pacific Northwest.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Not more of that crap from the Titanic?,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,No. No. It's a small men's carryall.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,I'm not carrying a purse.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,It's not a purse. It's European.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Oh.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,I don't know.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Yeah?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,What?,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,It's in... transit.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,Did he get it?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,No.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Allllll right!,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,What is that noise?,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,What are you talking about?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,What was that pop sound?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Well, I had some hard candy in there.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Come in, come in.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,This isn't about my opening your mail?,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,What?,12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Sorry. Climbers, keepers.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,You are?,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,Ha ha ha ha.,12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Uh, don't worry, he's cool.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,Cool?,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"All right, we're done here.",12,S09E12,9
NEWMAN,"For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.",12,S09E12,9
KERI,Nice carryall.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,It's European.,12,S09E12,9
KERI,Do you still have my lipstick?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?",12,S09E12,9
KERI,My job was to keep you away from the music.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"What, he doesn't like my taste in music?",12,S09E12,9
KERI,Guess not.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,"Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Hey, Silvio!",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,Look at this.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,Huh?,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,"Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Relax, Silvio.",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,"No, that's it. You're both out of the building!",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,A man's?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,Yeah.,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,What kind of a man would wear fur?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Oh, lots of 'em.",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,Would you?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,No.,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,Then who?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,What about Jerry?,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,Jerry?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,"Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, something like that.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,I have to do what?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,I'm not wearing the fur.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Is that right?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Newman, too?",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,That's my walkman!,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,And you'll get it back.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,All right.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Hey.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"George, did you get that chair yet?",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,Excuse me?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"No, you don't have to buy anything.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Your good friend is morbidly obese.,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,It's not a purse. It's European!,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,All right.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,There you go.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,How do I look?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,Ahh....,12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,"Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.",12,S09E12,9
GEORGE,My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,That is your coat?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,It sure is.,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,That's true.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, you forgot your purse.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Oh, thanks.",12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Maybe this isn't my coat.,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,"All right, you're not fancy!",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,"No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"No, that's not your coat.",12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,"If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,It's Joe Mayo's coat.,12,S09E12,9
SILVIO,Who's Joe Mayo?,12,S09E12,9
KRAMER,That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!,12,S09E12,9
COP,Your what?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"The...black, leather...thing with a strap.",12,S09E12,9
COP,You mean a purse?,12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,"So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,He should have had a reverse peephole.,12,S09E12,9
PUDDY,"Hey, Babe.",12,S09E12,9
JERRY,Hello? Hello?,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,What is that?,12,S09E12,9
PUDDY,It's my new coat.,12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,You ditched the fur?,12,S09E12,9
PUDDY,"Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.",12,S09E12,9
ELAINE,You're gonna wear this all the time?,12,S09E12,9
PUDDY,All signs point to 'Yes!',12,S09E12,9
JERRY,So your saying UNICEF is a scam?,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,She should just give up.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Heeyyy!...,13,S09E13,9
SALLY,Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from (?) Whoooooooo.....I'm on my way to an audition still waiting for that big break.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Why don't you just give up?,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Kramer!!!,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,So......Susan's dead.....,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,I think she was happy someone finally said it.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Why'd you have to say anything to her?,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,'felt that the conversation was lagging.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,What did you wanna be?,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,I don't either.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,And you're on the fringe of the humor business.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,Hey!,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Hey! George look at this.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,That's cute.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,You got it?,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"No, never mind.",13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail"".",13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,It's a page number.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"Well, I can't crack this one.",13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose",13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,We know what a face consists of.,13,S09E13,9
JANET,I'm sorry I'm late.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.",13,S09E13,9
JANET,Nice to meet you.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Hi!,13,S09E13,9
JANET,Do we still have time to make the movie?,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, She looks exactly like you.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,She does not.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Hey! Kramer.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said ""Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,What! You're the one who ruined her life.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Well that's not how she remembers it.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"Well, I got to talk her out of this.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,I thought you said she stinks,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Yeah...,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,Hey! George and Janet.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Aahh...Who's Janet?,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.,13,S09E13,9
ALL,"Hey, Hey!",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry",13,S09E13,9
JANET,well maybe we do look a little like each other.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.,13,S09E13,9
JANET,We just got here George,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"Well,,, it's getting dark.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"Well how should I have ""broached the subject""",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Yeah! Because of you.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"Well, I think one of us should leave.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.",13,S09E13,9
SALLY,(nods) Hehumm!!,13,S09E13,9

JERRY,Yeah right.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.",13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,Silence YES!!,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,Well what does this mean?,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,That's the idea.,13,S09E13,9

MR. ELINOFF,Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.,13,S09E13,9

MR. ELINOFF,Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?,13,S09E13,9
MR. ELINOFF,Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. (slides the magazine to her),13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)",13,S09E13,9
MR. ELINOFF,It's a slice of life.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,No it isn't.,13,S09E13,9
MR. ELINOFF,Pun?,13,S09E13,9

JERRY,Where did you see that? Those are private!!!,13,S09E13,9
SALLY,"Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.",13,S09E13,9
SALLY,Well...That is the title.,13,S09E13,9

ELAINE,That is not the point.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"some mouthwash, a hat, something.",13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Just read it!,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,(glances at it) Pretty good.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.,13,S09E13,9

ELAINE,"And he's saying "" I wish I was taller"" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,I get it.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"How 'bout if it was something like "" I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.",13,S09E13,9

JERRY,How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.,13,S09E13,9

DUGAN,You shouldn't make fun of pigs. (he leaves),13,S09E13,9
PETERMAN,(returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Oh! Do tell sir?,13,S09E13,9
PETERMAN,It's a Ziggy!,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,A Ziggy?,13,S09E13,9
PETERMAN,"That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.",13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,"You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.",13,S09E13,9

SALLY,"(joining Kramer) Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy, mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day, How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back, Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman, Sally Weaver the artist, Sally Weaver the person...",13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,"(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.",13,S09E13,9

GEORGE,"OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.",13,S09E13,9
JANET,George.,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,Your hair?,13,S09E13,9
JANET,Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed George. (George speeds out the door),13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,George is in big trouble....,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,You ripped off a Ziggy?,13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,"It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?",13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. ""The New Yorker is stealing my ideas."" ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.",13,S09E13,9
ELAINE,Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave),13,S09E13,9
JERRY,"Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.",13,S09E13,9

SALLY,Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??,13,S09E13,9
KRAMER,...All right ..Starting now......,13,S09E13,9
JERRY,You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?,13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,like that (looking at Jerry),13,S09E13,9
JERRY,You mean like.. (points to his hair),13,S09E13,9
GEORGE,..That.,13,S09E13,9

JERRY,She said no?,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,She said no.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,What did you do?,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Well, I don't really like her.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,That's good.,14,S09E14,9

JERRY,Hey.,14,S09E14,9

JERRY,"Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie ""Cinderfella"". I got 'em at an auction.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Oh, that'll intrigue him.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,George Peppard has been dead for years.,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"So, um, why don't we get together some time?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,I think it'd be better if I called you.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"Mm mm... no, not really.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,(seductive tone) I think you're very beautiful.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,What about Puddy?,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Which one is he?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Green suit, power ring.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly),14,S09E14,9

KRAMER,"No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,And... what would those be?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(doubtful) You were in the Army?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Literally.,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"No, go ahead.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Oh, come on!",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Oh!,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door),14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Well, that's classified.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Hey, what if he's married?",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Kramer?!,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"No, the Green Lantern.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,(from inside) OK!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs),14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,It was under a spoon!,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"No, George, we're not.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(gestures towards book) But I proved it!,14,S09E14,9
MAURA,I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys.,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"(assertive) I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"So, how is a guy like you not involved?",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,I might ask you the same thing.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Oh, that is so sweet.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"(seeing a woman on the street) Oh, no.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Who is it?,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"Um, uh, no one, no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Elaine, what are you doin' down there?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,You didn't hear me buzzing?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Oh, I guess it's broken!",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Throw down your key.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,I'll catch it!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,You'll chicken out at the last second.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Huh?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,All right.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Hey...,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving),14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,(from inside) Security issue!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Oh, hey. You got in.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(taking the menus) Oh, thanks.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,(clattering inside) That wasn't me!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"So, he's definitely married, huh?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Uh...,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Oh, come on!",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens),14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby),14,S09E14,9
Phil,(walking up to get inside after George) Thanks.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.,14,S09E14,9
PHIL,What?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.,14,S09E14,9
PHIL,"But, I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass),14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator),14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,Want a bite?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"(cheerily) Hey, Honey. (she sweeps in, shuts the door behind her, and sits down)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?,14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom),14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"(picking up the apple) Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot. (George freezes, shakes his head, and continues walking)",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Oh.,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"Ah, should I light a fire?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Oh, that sounds... romantic.",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window)",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"(leaning in) Can you get that, please?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Oh, sure.",14,S09E14,9
WOMAN,Where's Glenn?,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.",14,S09E14,9
WOMAN,"Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,This is his home?,14,S09E14,9
WOMAN,Yes.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"So, he's...",14,S09E14,9
WOMAN,(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo'),14,S09E14,9
GLENN,(coming back through the window carrying an old chair) I think this will burn!,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,So you do live here.,14,S09E14,9
PHIL,(sulkily) Yeah. (Jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,You live on this floor?,14,S09E14,9
PHIL,Yeah.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.",14,S09E14,9
PHIL,Yeah. (enters his apartment),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,So I guess I'll s--,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,How can I end it over money? I feel bad.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Good. How did you handle that?,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(entering Monk's) Hey.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Hey, where have you been?",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Who's this, Blue Arrow?",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Green Lantern.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,We found out his super power was lack of money.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(not amused) All right.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,He's invulnerable to creditors.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Thank you. (gets up from her seat),14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Really? How come you never pursued her before?,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke),14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,Heh.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,There's a giant parrot in the hallway.,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,It's Phil's.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Who?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,What'd ya tell him that for?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,He let you?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?",14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,I was in Maine for a couple days. (George looks puzzled at how she's so tanned),14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles),14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,"George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch),14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.,14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,"I want to build something with you, George.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Oh, not more building.",14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,(sighs) And I won't take no for an answer. (she sits down),14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,No?,14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,No.,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,It's a surprise.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(giggling) Oh.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,What are you doing? What is that?,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,It's a bag of donuts.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,It's garbage.,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?",14,S09E14,9
GLENN,(still looking through the garbage bag) It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,(eating the bear claw) Oooh!,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,Make it three hundred.,14,S09E14,9
GLENN,"(re the bear claw) You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece)",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Hi. Is Phil here?,14,S09E14,9
Phil,"(from inside the apartment) Yeah, I'm here. (comes to the door. The caged parrot is visible in the background)",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.",14,S09E14,9
PHIL,And?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.",14,S09E14,9
PHIL,That's my wife.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,This isn't going well.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Where are you goin'? Help me look!,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of ""Godspell"" with the other.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Which is with who?,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,I can't go until I find my cufflinks.,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Hey, what's going on?",14,S09E14,9
PHIL,Fredo is dead. (his wife sobs),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?,14,S09E14,9
PHIL,No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door),14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.",14,S09E14,9
PHIL,"Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"But I, I didn't, I--",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,Just get the key and let's get out of here.,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,What?,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,You killed Fredo!,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,You just answered your own question.,14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(frowning in realization) Oh, no!",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.",14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,"(shaking head, confused) What?",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.",14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,"Oh. (she smiles, reassured, and nods)",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,George?,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,You told me to meet you here for lunch.,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,(calmly ignoring George) I'm Maura. (shaking Loretta's hand and smiling),14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,"(to Maura, also friendly) I'm Loretta. You want to join us? (Maura nods and sits down next to her)",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,"George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.",14,S09E14,9
LORETTA,So can we.,14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?",14,S09E14,9
MAURA,No.,14,S09E14,9

JERRY,"Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.",14,S09E14,9
PHIL,"All right, Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!",14,S09E14,9

GEORGE,All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?,14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"Give me forty, you'll never see me again.",14,S09E14,9
ELAINE,"(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,"(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,"So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)",14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.",14,S09E14,9
JERRY,You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?,14,S09E14,9
KRAMER,"Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!",14,S09E14,9
GEORGE,When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,How much was it?,15,S09E15,9

GEORGE,Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,I got a message from the Rosses at work today.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,OK.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Still no Puddy?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?,15,S09E15,9

JERRY,"Isn't he, Elaine?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,You think?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,I thought he looked Irish.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,What's his last name?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Nelson.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,That's not Irish.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,I think he's black.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Should we be talkin' about this?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,I think it's OK.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"No, it isn't.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Why not?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,If he's black.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Is he black?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Does it matter?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Oh, so you need to know?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.",15,S09E15,9
WAITRESS,Should I take that?,15,S09E15,9

GEORGE,"George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.",15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,(walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.,15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,"Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.",15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,(again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.,15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,"Thank you for calling, George.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,House in the Hamptons?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,(enters) Well.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Hey.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Wow. What are we celebrating?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Uh, you remember my coffee table book?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,With the little legs?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,How are they gonna make that book into a movie?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?,15,S09E15,9

KRAMER,Independence Day?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Oh.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,How much are they payin' you?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,From what?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY & GEORGE,Ooh!,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Well, it's not really gold.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY & GEORGE,Aww.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Hey.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Great music.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it.",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Yo, you! Turn it down!",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,They're... African.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Right. African.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,South Africa.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Maybe.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.",15,S09E15,9
VENDER,Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Mmm... no.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"(Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,It's 530 in the morning!,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,We let you sleep in.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,What does that mean?,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,This looks like too much money.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,You think it's hot?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Could be.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!",15,S09E15,9
HELEN,I'm right here.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.",15,S09E15,9
HELEN,"Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Kramer, what are you doing here?",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,"Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"If you feed him, he'll never leave.",15,S09E15,9
HELEN,We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,(immaturely) I guess.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,I can't believe this.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Actually, I did have a thought.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Oh.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Why don't you just ask him?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Maybe he's, um... mixed.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Is that the right word?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Yeah.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Yeah.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.",15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,"Oh, you're George's friend.",15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,"We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Rosses.,15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,"George, we were just talking about you.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.",15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,Really?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"(eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Dad, it's got lots of other functions.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,Yay! Jerry got it open.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,We'll round down.,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,"Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,I was never impeached! I resigned!,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,"Even so, the press would bury him!",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,What press?,15,S09E15,9
HELEN,"The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,Pinko Commie rag.,15,S09E15,9
OLD MAN,"(coming up to the three Seinfelds) Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,She's fifty.,15,S09E15,9
OLD MAN,You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"All right, I'll see you guys.",15,S09E15,9
OLD MAN,Yeah.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,Yeah.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"I'll tell you what I'm looking at the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,Hmm.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Wow, it's got so many functions.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Well, I don't do that stuff.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Isn't that optional?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"All right, I'm... Asian.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,What?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Just to mess with 'em.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Really?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Does that matter?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"No, but... it is very nice to know.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Yeah, it's all my father's doing.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,(to George) He's still down with his folks.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"(overhearing the other two Elaine, Elaine--",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"(overhearing the other two) Oh, no.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,(to George) Mm-hmm.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,What about the mail?,15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"So, I ran into the Rosses again.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,From me.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,What did you say?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"So, they knew? Those liars!",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,But you lied first.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Like you're a liar!,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Haven't you done enough to these people?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.",15,S09E15,9
OLD WOMAN,Will you cut my meat?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,Gladly.,15,S09E15,9
WAITRESS,(to Darryl) Coffee?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Sure.,15,S09E15,9
WAITRESS,(to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"I'm black. (re-thinking) Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,What?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Interracial? Us?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Isn't that unbelievable!?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!",15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,I don't feel like eating.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,"Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.,15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,Sounds grand.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Do you have your bathing suits?,15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,It's March.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.",15,S09E15,9

MORTY,Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Well, I couldn't find my shoes.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.",15,S09E15,9
HELEN,Who wants hot chocolate?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah! Me.",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.,15,S09E15,9

JERRY,Kramer...,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"(rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.",15,S09E15,9
HELEN,"(running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,"Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Well, what about your deal, huh?",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.",15,S09E15,9

GEORGE,You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.,15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,Another solarium?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?",15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,What are their names?,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?,15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,"Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.",15,S09E15,9

WAITRESS,(leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,What are you talking about?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,We are. Because you're Hispanic.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,I am?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Aren't you?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,No. Why would you think that?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,That's because I thought you were black.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,I don't think we should be talking about this.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"So, what are you?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,I'm white.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,"So, we're just a couple of white people?",15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,I guess.,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,Oh.,15,S09E15,9
ELAINE,Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?,15,S09E15,9
DARRYL,(leaving with Elaine) Sure.,15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.",15,S09E15,9
JERRY,Aw.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"Congratulations, Mr. President.",15,S09E15,9
KRAMER,"Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.",15,S09E15,9
OLD MAN,"Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?",15,S09E15,9
MORTY,What are you talking about?,15,S09E15,9
OLD MAN,It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.,15,S09E15,9
MORTY,"This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.",15,S09E15,9

JERRY,It does other things!,15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,"Where are we, George?",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Almost there.,15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,"Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?",15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"We, uh, we go on foot from here.",15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,All right.,15,S09E15,9

MR. ROSS,We know.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,"Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?",15,S09E15,9
MRS. ROSS,"We don't like you, George.",15,S09E15,9
MR. ROSS,And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.,15,S09E15,9
GEORGE,Oh.,15,S09E15,9

PUDDY,"Two and ten, babe.",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Okay.,16,S09E16,9
PUDDY,Don't peel out.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,I won't.,16,S09E16,9
(Elaine peels out and turns on the car stereo. She hears,"""Jesus is one, Jesus is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall..."" Elaine changes the stations but all of the presets are set to religious radio stations; ""And he said unto Abraham..."", ""Amen! Amen!"", ""So we pray..."", ""Saved!"", ""Jey-sus!"" She turns off the radio.)",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Jesus?,16,S09E16,9
KRUGER,"According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.",16,S09E16,9
KRUGER,"Works for me. Good thinking, George.",16,S09E16,9
CO-WORKER #1,"Alright, George.",16,S09E16,9
CO-WORKER #2,Way to go man.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. ""Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger.""",16,S09E16,9
KRUGER,"Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.",16,S09E16,9
CO-WORKER #1,Good one.,16,S09E16,9
CO-WORKER #2,That was bad.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,And then?,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,I can't just leave.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,That's the way they do it in Vegas.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,You never played Vegas.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,I hear things.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Yes, he is lazy.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Yes, he is dumb.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Dumb and lazy, I understand.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,Tell you how you could check.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,How?,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,Well that's the gist of it!,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Quiet! So where is this Sophie?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,How long have you two been together?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE & GEORGE,Nah.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,I needed to move a bureau.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?",16,S09E16,9
MICKEY,Hey Jerry.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.",16,S09E16,9
MICKEY,Aah-choo.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,What's with the fake sneezing?,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.",16,S09E16,9
MICKEY,They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Do medical schools actually do this?,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER & MICKEY,HUAAHHH!!,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,I think the phone is ringing.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER & MICKEY,HUAAHHH!!,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Mickey, DTs.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Hello?,16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,Hey. It's me.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Elaine?,16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,"No, it's me.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,George??,16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,"Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,You got any Ipecac?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Did he overdose?,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"No, it's just too much.",16,S09E16,9
KRUGER,"...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.,16,S09E16,9
DR. WEXLER,In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.,16,S09E16,9
MICKEY,Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?,16,S09E16,9
MICKEY,"Sorry buddy, this is the ""Hamlet"" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.",16,S09E16,9
MAN,Sure.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Okay, what do you got?",16,S09E16,9
MAN,The surgeon left a sponge inside me.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,Good luck with that.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,What did you do the rest of the day?,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"I saw ""Titanic"". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Hello boys.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,I did.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,And the Christian rock?,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the ""It's me"" on the phone today.",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"""It's me?"" Isn't it a little premature?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,I thought so.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Hah. She's not a ""me"". I'm a ""me"".",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"I'm against all ""it's me""s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Well, I got gonorrhea.",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,That seems about right.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,That's what they gave me.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,They? The Government?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,What was that?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.",16,S09E16,9
STUDENT #1,And are you experiencing any discomfort?,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,Just a little burning during urination.,16,S09E16,9
STUDENT #1,"Okay, any other pain?",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,"The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.",16,S09E16,9
STUDENT #1,Gonorrhea?!,16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,Gonorrhea!,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,One message. Hope it's not from you.,16,S09E16,9
ANSWERING MACHINE,"""Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back.""",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Sophie.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,She's still doing that?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Yep.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the ""it's me"", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"I think that's a ""what's good for the goose is good for the gander"".",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"What the hell is a gander, anyway?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.",16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,Hey Raef.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Good, let her think it.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?",16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,Not a lot.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Ask about you, ask about you.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"So, uh, how are things with Jerry?",16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,"Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Right, right, the tractor story.",16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,"Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,I sound funny?,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,Abort! Abort!,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,That was very real.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,So where do you wanna eat?,16,S09E16,9
PUDDY,Feels like an Arby's night.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?,16,S09E16,9
PUDDY,Yes.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,"Oh. So, you're pretty religious?",16,S09E16,9
PUDDY,That's right.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?,16,S09E16,9
PUDDY,Not for me.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Why not?,16,S09E16,9
PUDDY,I'm not the one going to hell.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"No, she looks completely normal.",16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,You think she's got toes for thumbs?,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,I don't know.,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,Hands a little smelly?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Why do I seek your counsel?,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,Well I'm going to hell.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,That seems about right.,16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,According to Puddy.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--",16,S09E16,9
ELAINE,I'm not in the mood.,16,S09E16,9

GEORGE,A tractor.,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.,16,S09E16,9

GEORGE,"Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?,16,S09E16,9
GEORGE,"Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger?

SOPHIE,How could you know?,16,S09E16,9
JERRY,"(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.",16,S09E16,9

KRAMER,Oh. Hello.,16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,"No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.",16,S09E16,9
KRAMER,(to Mickey) You know? She's right.,16,S09E16,9
SOPHIE,"Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor.",16,S09E16,9
JERRY,You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??,16,S09E16,9

JERRY,What is that?,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.",18,S09E18,9
JERRY,So join in.,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,All right.,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Hey, wh-what--",18,S09E18,9

ELAINE,"Mr. Peterman, um--",18,S09E18,9
PETERMAN,"We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"No, sir, I can't.",18,S09E18,9
PETERMAN,"Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.",18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Well Lisi, that was another-",18,S09E18,9

LISI,Go for a hansom cab ride?,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?,18,S09E18,9
LISI,"84th street, right off Riverside Park.",18,S09E18,9
JERRY,Riverside Park.,18,S09E18,9
LISI,I thought we were going--,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,Back to my place. That's right.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,So you slept with her?,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,And you automatically sleep with her?,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,Finished your thought.,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,Guess what I ate.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,An ostrich burger.,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.",18,S09E18,9
JERRY,How'd it taste?,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,A little stale.,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,Yeah.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE (nudges Elaine with his elbow),"So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE (nudges George with her elbow),"No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.",18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,What is going on with you two?,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,What's that?,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,400 sugar fix.,18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Well, I'm calling this off right now.",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.",18,S09E18,9
JERRY,"Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,Just a little off the side...,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"Well, no point in wasting $1,200.",18,S09E18,9
ELAINE (thinking),"Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.",18,S09E18,9
SHLOMO,I don't know If I'm the best.,18,S09E18,9

SLIPPERY PETE,"You think you can handle that, numb nuts?",18,S09E18,9
KRAMER,"All right, all right, come on, now.",18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,That was my mail-order bride.,18,S09E18,9
KRAMER,"Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.",18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.,18,S09E18,9
KRAMER,You weren't even married yet.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.",18,S09E18,9
SHLOMO,So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,What do you mean?,18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,"We're stealing this thing, right?",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,No. I--I paid for it.,18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,I thought we were stealing it.,18,S09E18,9
KRAMER,Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,We're not stealing it.,18,S09E18,9
SHLOMO,I definitely thought we're stealing it.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?",18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,"Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?",18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,"Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.",18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,What's that?,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,The outlet?,18,S09E18,9

SHLOMO,They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,The Frogger is here.,18,S09E18,9
KRAMER,"George, I thought that was the door.",18,S09E18,9
SLIPPERY PETE,Where are all the pizza ovens?,18,S09E18,9
SHLOMO,I thought the bathroom was here.,18,S09E18,9
GEORGE,All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,I need to replace an antique piece of cake.,18,S09E18,9
ELAINE,"Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.",18,S09E18,9

JERRY,"Hi, Lisi.",18,S09E18,9
LISI,"Hi, honey. Is that a bat?",18,S09E18,9

GEORGE,"Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--",19,S09E19,9

GEORGE,How much you pay this maid?,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,40,19,S09E19,9
GEORGE,"40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.",19,S09E19,9

KRAMER,"Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.",19,S09E19,9

CINDY,Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.,19,S09E19,9
GEORGE,Really? Coco?,19,S09E19,9
CINDY,Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.,19,S09E19,9
GEORGE,"You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.",19,S09E19,9
JERRY,Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.,19,S09E19,9
GEORGE,Say good-bye to Koko.,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,"Good-bye, Koko.",19,S09E19,9
KRAMER,"Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.",19,S09E19,9
JERRY,"Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.",19,S09E19,9
KRAMER,"Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!",19,S09E19,9
CINDY,What was that?,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,I didn't hear anything.,19,S09E19,9

CINDY,I made the bed.,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,But you took a nap in it.,19,S09E19,9
CINDY,So?,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.,19,S09E19,9
CINDY,No. That was the maid.,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,"Well, who took the nap?",19,S09E19,9
CINDY,The girlfriend.,19,S09E19,9
JERRY,$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.,19,S09E19,9
CINDY,"So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?",19,S09E19,9
JERRY,"Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.",19,S09E19,9
CINDY,"You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.",19,S09E19,9

GEORGE,Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.,20,S09E20,9
JERRY,Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.,20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,"You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.",20,S09E20,9

KRAMER,"Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.",20,S09E20,9
SALES WOMAN,"Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know Mr. Varnsen",20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,"Uh, Varnsen.",20,S09E20,9
JERRY,Pennypacker.,20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,Vandelay.,20,S09E20,9
GEORGE,Pennypacker. Varnsen.,20,S09E20,9
JERRY,"Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?",20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,The factory?,20,S09E20,9
JERRY,The Saab factory?,20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,"Jerry, that's in Sweden.",20,S09E20,9
JERRY,My car!,20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,"Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.",20,S09E20,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, the Mets lost.",20,S09E20,9
JERRY,I love a parade!,20,S09E20,9
GEORGE,How do you suppose they did that?,20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,"Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?",20,S09E20,9
JERRY,"Well, what about my car?",20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,"Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.",20,S09E20,9
JERRY,"Hey, there's Elaine.",20,S09E20,9
ELAINE,Hey.,20,S09E20,9
JERRY,"Well, you look, uh...relaxed.",20,S09E20,9
ELAINE,"Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.",20,S09E20,9
LAMAR,"Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around!",20,S09E20,9
JERRY,"Well, at least he didn't-",20,S09E20,9
LAMAR,Jackass!,20,S09E20,9
JERRY,Somebody remember where we parked.,20,S09E20,9
KRAMER,This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.,20,S09E20,9
GEORGE,"I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?""",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,I know what you mean.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Do ya?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Same thing!,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?,23,S09E23,9
WOMAN,What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?,23,S09E23,9
MAN,It's up to you.,23,S09E23,9
WOMAN,You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Nah - what for?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,To see a movie.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I've been to the movies.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Not this movie.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Did you shower today?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Yeah.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.,23,S09E23,9
WOMAN,"All right, we're done. You can have it now.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Oh, very gracious.",23,S09E23,9
MAN,Nice day,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Yeah.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,What is that?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,Hey! JoJo!,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Ey, ey!",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"No, thank you. So what are you doing?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Nothing.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Come on, let's go to the beach.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,What are you crazy?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,What? It's a beautiful day.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Have a good time.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, there's something in the air.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What? No good?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Faux pas.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Faux pas?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Big hefty stinking faux pas.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Why?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street.""",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It's dismissive.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,It's pompous.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Why don't you think before you do something?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Here's a thought - Bye bye.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Too much?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Hey - hey - hey!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,What?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,You're so uptight.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.",23,S09E23,9
PHONE TAPE,"Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Who's he?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about ""Jerry.""",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Our show, ""Jerry""?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Right.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Yeah!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,When?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Today, like right now.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Right now? ""Jerry""?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"""Jerry""!",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"""Jerry""!",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"""Jerry""!",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Can I go like this?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Sure!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Forget the sports jacket.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I won't feel like a writer.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,You're not a writer.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Right!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Water. Need some water! Water here!,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Don't blow this.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I will not blow this.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,He might not want nothing.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Something, nothing, I could care less.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,He might want a show about anything and everything.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,All right.,23,S09E23,9
RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Magic time.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,What?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,nothing,23,S09E23,9
RECEPTIONIST,Mr. Kimbrough.,23,S09E23,9
STU,"Hey, Jerry, good to see you.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Hey, hey, hey!",23,S09E23,9
STU,How you been?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Good, good. You remember George.",23,S09E23,9
STU,"George, good to see you.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Hello Stu.,23,S09E23,9
STU,You remember Jay Crespi.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?",23,S09E23,9
STU,This is James Kimbrough.,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Kimbrough.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Don't spell.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,That's right.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It's a talent I have.,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Shut up, George.",23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,Can I get you anything?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,What do we have in the fruit department?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Oy.,23,S09E23,9
STU,Pineapple.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.",23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Been there, done that.",23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Water coolers?,23,S09E23,9
CRESPI,We call it a water-cooler show.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than ""coffee machine show.""",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he developed five years ago.",23,S09E23,9
STU,I have always loved it.,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.",23,S09E23,9
CRESPI,He totally flipped out.,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,He's a little off the wall.,23,S09E23,9
CRESPI,Oh yeah.,23,S09E23,9
STU,Kramer.,23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Definitely.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.",23,S09E23,9
KIMBROUGH,"Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Or we could get them together. Woo!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Yeah!,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Yeah!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Hi. Elaine, it's me.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, I'm on the other line.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,That's the emergency?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Did you hear what I said?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,I was on the other line talking to Jill.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,You said it was an emergency.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.,23,S09E23,9
HELEN,"Congratulations, they're doing the show.",23,S09E23,9
MORTY,"They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.",23,S09E23,9
HELEN,She's not six-six.,23,S09E23,9
MORTY,"Jerry, you ever watch that?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Yeah, it's pretty good.",23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,They picked up the show?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I'm moving to California.,23,S09E23,9
FRANK,"Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.",23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,The NBC guy liked it?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Of course he liked it.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,He told you he liked it?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,"Well, what are you doing?",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I'm writing.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,You know how to write?,23,S09E23,9
FRANK,"Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.",23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Ma?!,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?,23,S09E23,9
FRANK,Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,Oh hey!,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Hey - how was the beach?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,You're moving to California?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Yeah, only for a while.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"No, I'll be back.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,Fling!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,So we can go anywhere we want?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Anywhere.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Why are they doing this?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,This is all very exciting.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,So? Where are we going?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,I say Japan.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Why Japan?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Oh - I got it - how about Russia?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Russia, it's so bleak.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,It's not bleak - it's springtime.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,It's still bleak.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,You can't be bleak in spring.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,You can be bleak in spring.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"If you're bleak, you're bleak.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What about Switzerland?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It's a bit hilly - no?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,You're not going to do any walking.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,What if I want to walk around a little?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,What if I'm at the bottom?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"All right! You know what, just forget it!",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,I'll go to Paris.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Me too.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,Oh yeah - oui oui.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.",23,S09E23,9
GROUP,Yeah!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.",23,S09E23,9
NEWMAN,"Hello, Jerry.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Hello, Newman. What gives?",23,S09E23,9
NEWMAN,I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Yeah, that's right.",23,S09E23,9
NEWMAN,"Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Really.,23,S09E23,9
NEWMAN,"Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,That's a shame.,23,S09E23,9
NEWMAN,Take me! Take me!,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!",23,S09E23,9
NEWMAN,"All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.",23,S09E23,9
CAPTAIN,"Ah, Jerry?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Yeah.,23,S09E23,9
CAPTAIN,"I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,All set. We'll just grab the bags.,23,S09E23,9
CAPTAIN,Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Just keeps on getting better and better.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Not bad.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Wow!,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,The only way to fly.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,This is it?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,You're complaining about a private jet?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,You're not writing any letters!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Will you turn around?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Why?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It's effeminate to sit like this?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,How is this effeminate?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,I don't know - it just is.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Kramer, what are you doing?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Still got water in your ear?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Kramer!,23,S09E23,9
CAPTAIN,"Hey, get the hell out of here!",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What is that?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Oh my God!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What is that noise? What is that noise?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Kramer, what the hell did you do?",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,I lost my balance.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Oh my God!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What's going on?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Kramer!,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,It was an accident.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I told you to stop with the hopping.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Yeah.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,There's something I have to tell you.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,What? What is it?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I cheated in the contest.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,What?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,The contest - I cheated.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Why?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Great - I won.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,No no - me first.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Alright.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Jerry, I've always loved ..u..",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Hey - What's going on?,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,We're straightening out!,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,We're straightening out?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,We're straightening out!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,We're straightening out!,23,S09E23,9
GROUP,Yeah!,23,S09E23,9
CAPTAIN,"Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Where are we?,23,S09E23,9
CAPTAIN,"Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Okay.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Okay.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,We'll see you later.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Alright, I'll feel him out.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.",23,S09E23,9
STRANGER,Nice day.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Another one?,23,S09E23,9
ROBBER,"Alright fatso, out of the car.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,I want to capture this.,23,S09E23,9
ROBBER,Come on! Gimme your wallet.,23,S09E23,9
VOGEL,Don't shoot.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,23,S09E23,9
ROBBER,"I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.",23,S09E23,9
VOGEL,"Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Forget it.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.",23,S09E23,9
OFFICER,"All right, hold it right there.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,What?,23,S09E23,9
OFFICER,You're under arrest.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Under arrest? What for?,23,S09E23,9
OFFICER,Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"What? No, no - we didn't do anything.",23,S09E23,9
OFFICER,That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I never heard of that.,23,S09E23,9
OFFICER,It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Why would we want to help somebody?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,I know.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.",23,S09E23,9
DEPUTY,"Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Oh, yeah.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Oh, yeah.",23,S09E23,9
DEPUTY,"You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.",23,S09E23,9
DEPUTY,"Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.,23,S09E23,9
DEPUTY,"California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.",23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.,23,S09E23,9
SECRETARY,Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away.",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,I guess we could've called for help.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,But then we would have missed the whole thing.,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Yeah, he's right.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,I forgot about the video.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Sure - the video.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,What is that?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Plane's ready.,23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,"Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-",23,S09E23,9
WELLS,"Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.",23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,What's the mood? What's going on tonight?,23,S09E23,9
WELLS,"Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.",23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?,23,S09E23,9
WELLS,"Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote ""There's no love lost with that group.""",23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,"Anything else, Jane?",23,S09E23,9
WELLS,"There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.",23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.",23,S09E23,9
HELEN,I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.,23,S09E23,9
MORTY,What's all that?,23,S09E23,9
HELEN,Cereal.,23,S09E23,9
MORTY,You're packing cereal?,23,S09E23,9
HELEN,I'm bringing it for Jerry.,23,S09E23,9
MORTY,You got enough here for a life sentence.,23,S09E23,9
HELEN,He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.,23,S09E23,9
MORTY,So bring a snack-pack.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,"Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.",23,S09E23,9
FRANK,Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,"Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.",23,S09E23,9
FRANK,You were the one who smothered him.,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,I did not smother him.,23,S09E23,9
FRANK,You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!,23,S09E23,9
ESTELLE,"Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.",23,S09E23,9
FRANK,I had to make a living!,23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,I bet.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Good morning.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Good morning, Jackie.",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Good morning.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It makes me look older.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.",23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Do you think it's funny?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,No.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"How do I look, Jackie?",23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Thank you, Jackie.",23,S09E23,9
KRAMER,"How bout me, Jackie?",23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.",23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Here.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,This one?,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,That's right.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Do I have to?,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"Jackie says put it on, Jerry.",23,S09E23,9
BAILIFF,"All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Vanda who?,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Jerry, did you hear that?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Yeah.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,I think that's a good sign.,23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"We are, Your Honor.",23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,Mr. Hoyt.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.",23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,Mr. Chiles.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.",23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.",23,S09E23,9
BAILIFF,Call Matt Vogel.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,So they were just standing there?,23,S09E23,9
VOGEL,Yes.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Did one of them have a video camera?,23,S09E23,9
VOGEL,Yes.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.",23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,Proceed.,23,S09E23,9
VOGEL,Don't shoot.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,"See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,23,S09E23,9
[New Witness,the victim of the robbery],23,S09E23,9
HOYT,So they just stood there and did nothing?,23,S09E23,9
VOGEL,"Yeah, nothing. Nothing!",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,No further questions.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Call Mabel Choate to the stand.,23,S09E23,9
BAILIFF,Call Mabel Choate.,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,"Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.",23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.",23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,"Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,What did he want?,23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,My marble rye.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Your marble rye?,23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,"I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no.",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,And then you left the bakery.,23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,That's right.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?",23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,Oh no.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Gimme that rye.,23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,Stop it.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,I want that rye lady.,23,S09E23,9
CHOATE,Help - someone help.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"Shut up, you old bag!",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,No further questions.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,I call Marla Penny to the stand.,23,S09E23,9
BAILIFF,Call Marla Penny.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,The virgin!,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,And what was your connection to the defendants?,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.",23,S09E23,9
PENNY,It's rather difficult to talk about.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,It's alright. Take your time.,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,"Well, I became aware of a -",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,A what?,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,"A, uh -",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Yes?,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,A contest.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Contest?,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,Yes.,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,What was the nature of the contest?,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,"Oh please, I can't.",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,It's okay.,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,The four of them made a wager to see if they could -,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Yes?,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.,23,S09E23,9
PETERMAN,For the love of God!,23,S09E23,9
PENNY,"It was horrible, horrible!",23,S09E23,9
HOYT,Call Donald Sanger to the stand.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Who the hell is that?,23,S09E23,9
MR. SANGER,"Come on Donald, you're doing fine.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,The Bubble Boy!,23,S09E23,9
CHILES,Bubble Boy?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,"That's right, the Bubble Boy.",23,S09E23,9
CHILES,What's a Bubble Boy?,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,He's a boy who lives in a bubble.,23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,What the hell are all you looking at?,23,S09E23,9
HOYT,"So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.",23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,"Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?,23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,That's a joke - the Moors.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.",23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,"Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,"Sorry, the card says Moops.",23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,It's Moops.,23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,Moors!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Moops!,23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Help! Someone!,23,S09E23,9
BUBBLE BOY,"There's no Moops, you idiot.",23,S09E23,9

WELLS,"Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.",23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.,23,S09E23,9
WELLS,"Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.",23,S09E23,9
RIVERA,"Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?",23,S09E23,9
WELLS,"That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure.

Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.",23,S09E23,9

FOREMAN,We find the defendants - guilty.,23,S09E23,9
VANDELAY,"Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.",23,S09E23,9

ELAINE,"If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?",23,S09E23,9
JERRY,Sure.,23,S09E23,9
ELAINE,Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.,23,S09E23,9
JERRY,I think that would be a very nice gesture.,23,S09E23,9

JERRY,"See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.",23,S09E23,9
GEORGE,Really?,23,S09E23,9

JERRY,"So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?",23,S09E23,9
PRISONER 1,I am.,23,S09E23,9
